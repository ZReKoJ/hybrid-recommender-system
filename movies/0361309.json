{"Title":"We Don't Live Here Anymore","Year":"2004","Rated":"R","Released":"03 Sep 2004","Runtime":"101 min","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Director":"John Curran","Writer":"Andre Dubus (short stories \"We Don't Live Here Anymore\" and \"Adultery\"), Larry Gross (screenplay)","Actors":"Mark Ruffalo, Laura Dern, Peter Krause, Naomi Watts","Plot":"The movie is set in the Pacific Northwest; specifically, Washington state. We know this from a glimpse of a license plate, the craftsman architecture of the two houses, and the mature, rich landscapes in between. The setting, like the scrutiny of the four main character's lives, is defined by the narrowness of the camera's field-of view. The one commercial street in town is only seen in the reflection of a store window, a shot of a non-descript auto-yard, or the tunnel of a tree-lined suburban sidewalk. The lush, wooded landscape is understood as an immediate presence in the domestic and professional lives of the characters; a steep hill, railroad tracks, a rushing stream, and a path over an old steel bridge are revisited again and again by the characters in their capacities as lovers, parents and friends.","Language":"English","Country":"USA, Canada","Awards":"2 wins & 4 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MTA4MjAyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYyNjYyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"65%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"66/100"}],"Metascore":"66","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"9,140","imdbID":"tt0361309","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Renaissance Films, Front Street Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
