Two men who are both thuggish and philosophical send him to Madrid with cryptic instructions. Over the course of a few days, he receives his instructions from a series of distinctive individuals who provide words of philosophy or of warning and also give him a matchbox with a tiny piece of paper, which he reads then eats, accompanied by espresso served in two cups. He is quiet, self-contained, focused on his work. He has rules. He encounters and at times transmits a violin, diamonds, a guitar, and a map. Is he a smuggler? Merely an independent conduit? Or, something else?","Language":"English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Japanese","Country":"USA, Japan","Awards":"1 win.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5ODk3NjE1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE3MTA0Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"42%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"41/100"}],"Metascore":"41","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"19,360","imdbID":"tt1135092","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Pointblank Pictures","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
