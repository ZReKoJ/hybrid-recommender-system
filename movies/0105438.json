Throughout his life, he has worked on the same theme many times, almost as if it were a physical necessity. Every year, with the arrival of autumn, this need resurfaces. The artist's work has never represented the sun's rays between the leaves of the tree, and, given his characteristic realist style, he tries to achieve this. But he goes about it in the same way, without consciously pursuing a finished picture - he just wants to be close to the fragile lavish tree for a few weeks.","Language":"Spanish, Polish, Mandarin","Country":"Spain","Awards":"8 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkZjRmZTItYTU1Ni00YWQ2LWEyZjUtZGViMmRmZjkwMTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"89%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"82/100"}],"Metascore":"82","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"1,586","imdbID":"tt0105438","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Maria Moreno P.C.","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
