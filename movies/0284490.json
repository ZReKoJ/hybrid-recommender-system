LAPD Patrol Officer Trey Sellars joined the force as a day job until his acting career took off. During an undercover drug buy Mitch was working that Trey botched by calling in for backup and drawing media attention, Mitch's partner is shot with a very exotic 12-gauge automatic weapon; Mitch then shoots the video camera out of the hands of a reporter filming the action when the cameraman refused to shut it down. Faced with a $10 million lawsuit, the department agrees to let producer Chase Renzi film Mitch's investigation for a new reality TV show, and constantly tries to make everything more \"viewer friendly\" by changing everything about Mitch's life to fit the stereotypical view of police officers--and partners him with Trey.","Language":"English","Country":"USA, Australia","Awards":"1 win & 6 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQzNGUyYzEtYzhlOC00YTQzLWJmOGYtOTNlMzE1Yjk4MDkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMzE4Mzg@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"25%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"32/100"}],"Metascore":"32","imdbRating":"5.5","imdbVotes":"60,106","imdbID":"tt0284490","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Tribeca Productions, Warner Brothers, Overbrook Entertainment, Village Roadshow Prod., Material","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
