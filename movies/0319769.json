Six men worked in a shipyard, now shuttered. They pass the time at La Naval, a bar opened by one of them after the yard closed. They face their futures in makeshift ways: Rico has his bar and a sharp 15-year-old daughter, Reina has become a watchman and a moralizer, Lino fills out job applications, Amador drinks heavily and talks of his wife's return; José is married to Ana, who works at a cannery and tires of being the breadwinner amidst José's emasculated moodiness; Santa, the group's conscience and troublemaker, occasionally fantasizes about Australia. In truth, all are joined like Siamese twins, adrift.","Language":"Spanish","Country":"Spain, France, Italy","Awards":"46 wins & 19 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTYzYTAxYTMtOGI3Ni00MTk0LWFjMzEtYzc2MjdlZWY2MzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"80%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"64/100"}],"Metascore":"64","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"13,012","imdbID":"tt0319769","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Televisión de Galicia (TVG) S.A., Instituto de la Cinematografía y de las Artes Audiovisuales, Mediapro, Vía Digital, Eurimages, Elías Querejeta Producciones Cinematográficas S.L., Antena 3 Televisión, Sogepaq, Quo Vadis Cinéma, Continental Producciones, Eyescreen S.r.l.","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
