Working-class lovers, Renzo and Luciana, marry but must hide it from her employer; plus, they need a room of their own. A billboard of Anita Ekberg provocatively selling milk gives a prudish crusader for public decency more than he can handle. The wife of a count whose escapades with call girls make the front page of the papers decides to work to prove her independence, but what is she qualified to do? A buxom carnival-booth manager who owes back taxes offers herself for one night in a lottery: a nerdy sacristan and a jealous cowboy make for a lovers' triangle. In each, women take charge, but not always happily.","Language":"Italian, German","Country":"Italy, France","Awards":"1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM1MjVkZWItMTYxYi00YzNkLTk1NjktNTY3OTc1MGI1ZGQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIzNDU1NTY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"50%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"3,764","imdbID":"tt0055805","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
