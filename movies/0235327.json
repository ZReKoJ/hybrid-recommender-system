{"Title":"Dark Days","Year":"2000","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"09 Mar 2001","Runtime":"82 min","Genre":"Documentary","Director":"Marc Singer","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"Marc Singer","Plot":"Near Penn Station, next to the Amtrak tracks, squatters have been living for years. Marc Singer goes underground to live with them, and films this \"family.\" A dozen or so men and one woman talk about their lives: horrors of childhood, jail time, losing children, being coke-heads. They scavenge, they've built themselves sturdy one-room shacks; they have pets, cook, chat, argue, give each other haircuts. A bucket is their toilet. Leaky overhead pipes are a source of water for showers. They live in virtual darkness. During the filming, Amtrak gives a 30-day eviction notice.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"7 wins & 6 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NjM1NjM0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUxMDgyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"94%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"75/100"}],"Metascore":"75","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"6,308","imdbID":"tt0235327","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Picture Farm","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
