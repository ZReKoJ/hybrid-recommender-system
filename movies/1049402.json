Howl, the film, recounts this dark moment using three interwoven threads: the tumultuous life events that led a young Allen Ginsberg to find his true voice as an artist, society's reaction (the obscenity trial), and animation that echoes the poem's surreal style. All three coalesce in hybrid that dramatizes the birth of a counterculture.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 wins & 8 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MTMzNTMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTMyMTY2Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"63%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"63/100"}],"Metascore":"63","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"12,483","imdbID":"tt1049402","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Telling Pictures, RabbitBandini Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
