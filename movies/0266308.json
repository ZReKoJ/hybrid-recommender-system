A group of ninth-grade students from a Japanese high school have been forced by legislation to compete in a Battle Royale. The students are each given a bag with a randomly selected weapon and a few rations of food and water and sent off to kill each other in a no-holds-barred (with a few minor rules) game to the death, which means that the students have three days to kill each other until one survives--or they all die. The movie focuses on a few of the students and how they cope. Some decide to play the game like the psychotic Kiriyama or the sexual Mitsuko, while others like the heroes of the movie--Shuya, Noriko, and Kawada--are trying to find a way to get off the Island without violence. However, as the numbers dwell down lower and lower on an hourly basis, is there any way for Shuya and his classmates to survive?","Language":"Japanese","Country":"Japan","Awards":"7 wins & 9 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2MGYwYzAtNzE2Yi00YmU3LTkxMDUtODk2YjhiNDM5NDIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwNDU1MzEy._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"88%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"81/100"}],"Metascore":"81","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"167,598","imdbID":"tt0266308","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Battle Royale Prod.
