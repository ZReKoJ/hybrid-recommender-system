This fish pervades the entire film, in real and imaginary form. Meanwhile, Axel tags fish in New York as a naturalist's gofer. He's happy there, but a messenger arrives to bring him to Arizona for his uncle's wedding. It's a ruse to get Axel into the family business. In Arizona, Axel meets two odd women: vivacious, needy, and plagued by neuroses and familial discord. He gets romantically involved with one, while the other, rich but depressed, plays accordion tunes to a gaggle of pet turtles.","Language":"English, Spanish, Inuktitut","Country":"USA, France","Awards":"4 wins & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjViZTgwMGUtNTJkNS00Mjg1LTkwZWQtNTg1YWEyOWFhY2I0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQ2MTMzODA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"87%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"40,498","imdbID":"tt0106307","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Constellation","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
