{"Title":"Genius Party","Year":"2007","Rated":"N/A","Released":"07 Jul 2007","Runtime":"85 min","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Fantasy","Director":"Nicolas de Crécy, Atsuko Fukushima, Yoji Fukuyama, Hideki Futamura, Shôji Kawamori, Shinji Kimura, Mahiro Maeda, Kôji Morimoto, Kazuto Nakazawa, Tatsuyuki Tanaka, Shin'ichirô Watanabe, Hiro Yamagata, Masaaki Yuasa, Shin'ya Ôhira","Writer":"Yoji Fukuyama, Hideki Futamura, Shôji Kawamori, Mitsuyoshi Takasu, Masaaki Yuasa","Actors":"Tomoko Kaneda, Rinko Kikuchi, Kaoru Mizuhara, Lu Ningjuan","Plot":"Seven short films from different directors. Atsuko Fukushima's intro piece is a fantastic abstraction to soak up with the eyes. Masaaki Yuasa, of MIND GAME and CAT SOUP fame, brings his distinctive and deceptively simple graphic style and dream-state logic to the table with \"Happy Machine,\" his spin on a child's earliest year. Shinji Kimura's spookier \"Deathtic 4,\" meanwhile, seems to tap into the creepier corners of a child's imagination and open up a toybox full of dark delights. Hideki Futamura's \"Limit Cycle\" conjures up a vision of virtual reality, while Yuji Fukuyama's \"Doorbell\" and \"Baby Blue\" by Shinichiro Watanabe use understated realism for very surreal purposes. And Shoji Kawamori, with \"Shanghai Dragon,\" takes the tropes and conventions of traditional anime out for very fun joyride.","Language":"Japanese","Country":"Japan","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ1ZmVlMjUtMzQyNC00YWNiLWE3MmEtN2U0ODU1YWNiZmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI2NDI0MDk@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"44%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"1,154","imdbID":"tt0962762","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
