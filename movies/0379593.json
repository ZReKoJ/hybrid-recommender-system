The film begins when two members of The Yes Men, Andy and Mike, set up a website that mimics the World Trade Organization's--and it's mistaken for the real thing. They play along with the ruse and soon find themselves invited to important functions as WTO representatives. Delighted to represent the organization they politically oppose, Andy and Mike don thrift-store suits and set out to shock unwitting audiences with darkly comic satire that highlights the worst aspects of global free trade.","Language":"English, French","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMjI2NzgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDIyMzk3NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"85%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"68/100"}],"Metascore":"68","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"5,554","imdbID":"tt0379593","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Yes Men Films LLC","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
