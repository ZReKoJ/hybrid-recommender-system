When he gets a job disappointment, David convinces Linda that they should quit their jobs, liquidate their assets, and emulate the movie Easy Rider, spending the rest of their lives travelling around America...in a Winnebago! (This is a kind of large, luxurious mobile home which suits a 1980's yuppie more than the counterculture dropout approach of Easy Rider.) His idealized, unrealistic plans soon begin to go spectacularly wrong.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU4ZTQ5NjktZGFlYy00NTFkLTkwZTItZjE1NDgwMmYwZjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"97%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"78/100"}],"Metascore":"78","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"7,489","imdbID":"tt0089504","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Marty Katz Productions, The Geffen Company","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
