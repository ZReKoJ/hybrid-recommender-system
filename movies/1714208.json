Stripped of clothes and anything that could tie her to the human race, the human-like savage beast will seem as the perfect trophy to the eyes of Chris, a misogynistic lawyer, who will hunt the woman down, and like the most precious and elusive prey, he will manage to capture her and bring her home. However, is there a place for a feral, flesh-eating primitive who communicates with grunts and growls, among civilised people? In the days to come, Chris will make the woman his project, and like a proud predator kept in captivity, with the help of his dysfunctional family, he will attempt to domesticate the untamed female by sadistically breaking her will. Soon enough though, no restraints, no training, and certainly no male supremacy will be no match for the raging woman's raw and merciless punishment.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"12 wins & 4 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmM3ZmFmNDctMDEwZS00ODhlLWE0OWQtZTljMGNiZjg2ZTFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"73%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"58/100"}],"Metascore":"58","imdbRating":"6.0","imdbVotes":"21,778","imdbID":"tt1714208","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Modernciné","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
