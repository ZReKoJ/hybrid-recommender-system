He's late, she's gone on to Niagara Falls, so he has two days, traveling slowly and reluctantly, to get to the wedding. At the airport, he meets Alicia, a lively Latin, going with her boyfriend to see her family. George is smitten. Partly by happenstance, and partly by the designs of Gerard, a romantic and manic Frenchman George meets at the airport, his path crosses Alicia's a few times. As Gerard puts it, George should seize the chance to see what happens with Alicia - he can always jump tomorrow. Can George take on fate and custom?","Language":"English, French, Spanish","Country":"UK, USA","Awards":"3 wins & 6 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyNzk1MDEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg5OTYyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"81%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"68/100"}],"Metascore":"68","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"1,332","imdbID":"tt0273300","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Channel 4 Television Corporation","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
