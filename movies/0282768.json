He'll swap places with commoner Eugene Lenormand, sneak into Paris, then Lenormand will reveal himself and Napoleon will regain his throne. Things don't go at all well; first, the journey proves more difficult than expected, but more disastrously, Lenormand enjoys himself too much to reveal the deception. Napoleon adjusts somewhat uneasily to the life of a commoner while waiting, while Lenormand gorges on rich food.","Language":"English","Country":"Italy, UK, Germany","Awards":"1 win.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThkNjhhYWEtOTdhNi00ZDdkLTk0NjEtMzA2NDE1ODExY2FkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"73%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"60/100"}],"Metascore":"60","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"2,457","imdbID":"tt0282768","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Redwave Films, Mikado Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
