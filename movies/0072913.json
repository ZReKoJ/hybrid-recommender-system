But as the flying guillotine master is blind, he starts his quest by becoming a serial killer of one-armed men. Meanwhile, the one-armed boxer is running a martial arts school, where he teaches his pupils to control their breath so they can run up walls and along ceilings. And there's an Indian fakir whose arms can extend until they're ten feet long. As you may have gathered, a rational plot summary is pretty pointless - but rest assured there are epic martial arts battles and ludicrously inspired moments galore.","Language":"Mandarin","Country":"Hong Kong, Taiwan","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNjYxMDU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAwMDM4ODE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"90%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"57/100"}],"Metascore":"57","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"4,121","imdbID":"tt0072913","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
