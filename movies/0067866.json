El Topo (the mole) claims to be God, while dressed as a gunfighter in black, riding a horse through a spiritual, mystical landscape strewn with old Western movie, and ancient Eastern religious symbols. Bandits slaughtered a village on his path, so El Topo avenges the massacred, then forcibly takes their leader's woman Mara as his. El Topo's surreal way is bloody, sexual and self-reflective, musing of his own demons, as he tries to vanquish those he encounters.","Language":"Spanish","Country":"Mexico","Awards":"4 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUzMWQzMTItYzZiOS00NmI1LWIzMTgtOWE4NzE1M2NhY2IxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"79%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"65/100"}],"Metascore":"65","imdbRating":"7.4","imdbVotes":"25,187","imdbID":"tt0067866","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Producciones Panicas","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
