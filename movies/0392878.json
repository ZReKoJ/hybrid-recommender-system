In addition to watching the news, we see the program's commercials, some commentary on the film as it proceeds, and we watch some terrorists in training. Behind the scenes, Onion News's corporate owner, Global Tetrahedron, seeks synergy by promoting its other products within Norm's news broadcast. Norm doesn't like it, especially when a toy penguin (think Energizer Bunny) waddles across his desk promoting a Global Tetrahedron film starring Steven Seagal. But Norm may end up needing Steven's help.","Language":"English, Russian, Spanish","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQyNjcyMjUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgxMDA2MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"46%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"15,309","imdbID":"tt0392878","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"3 Arts Entertainment, New Regency Pictures, Fox Searchlight","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
