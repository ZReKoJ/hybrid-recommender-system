Literally all their free time is spent building flame-throwers and weapons of mass destruction in hopes that a global apocalypse will occur and clear the runway for their imaginary gang \"Mother Medusa\". While waiting for the world to end, their call to excitement comes unexpectedly when one of them meets a charismatic young woman and falls hard in love. Quickly integrated into a new group of friends, they set off on a journey of betrayal, love, hate, infidelity and extreme violence more devastating and fiery than any of their apocalyptic fantasies. Often life's simplest and most obvious truths are the hardest to see, but once you've burned everything to the ground it may be the only thing left standing.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"5 wins & 8 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4OTM5MDU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM3ODYyNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"73%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"72/100"}],"Metascore":"72","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"7,488","imdbID":"tt1242599","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Coatwolf Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
