Hidden within the messaging app is Textopolis, a bustling city where all your favorite emojis live, hoping to be selected by the phone's user. In this world, each emoji has only one facial expression - except for Gene, an exuberant emoji who was born without a filter and is bursting with multiple expressions. Determined to become \"normal\" like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of his handy best friend Hi-5 and the notorious code breaker emoji Jailbreak. Together, they embark on an epic \"app-venture\" through the apps on the phone, each its own wild and fun world, to find the Code that will fix Gene. But when a greater danger threatens the phone, the fate of all emojis depends on these three unlikely friends who must save their world before it's deleted forever.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"USA","Awards":"5 wins & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMzM3OTM2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM0NDU3MjI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"3.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"7%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"12/100"}],"Metascore":"12","imdbRating":"3.3","imdbVotes":"55,305","imdbID":"tt4877122","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Sony Pictures Animation","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
