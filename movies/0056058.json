An honorable end to such fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted disembowelment). An elder warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at the house but was instead barbarically forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in an excruciating manner with a dull bamboo blade. In flashbacks the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child. Tsugumo thus sets in motion a tense showdown of revenge against the house.","Language":"Japanese","Country":"Japan","Awards":"8 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjBmYTQ1NjItZWU5MS00YjI0LTg2OTYtYmFkN2JkMmNiNWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"85/100"}],"Metascore":"85","imdbRating":"8.6","imdbVotes":"40,319","imdbID":"tt0056058","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Shôchiku Eiga","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
