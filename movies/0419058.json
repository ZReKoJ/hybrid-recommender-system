Then Raju finds out that he can double his wealth in 21 days, and meets with an attractive young woman named Anuradha from an agency in Bombay's business district. She informs him that the minimum investment is one Crore, and Raju quickly agrees to invest this money. He dupes another man by the name of Pappu into parting with 50 Lakhs, and the rest of the money comes through by getting Shyam and Babu to sign away their respective investments. After 21 days when the trio go to collect their doubled wealth, they find that Anuradha and her company have disappeared. Devastated, they move out of their bungalow and are now living in a shanty room in a Chawl when they get a visit from Pappu, who wants his money back, as he owes this money to Tiwari, an underworld Don. The trio decide to meet with Tiwari and plead with him, but all in vain, then they decide to stage a robbery, however, that does not go well either.
