A village teacher in Iran tries to explain to her young students what's happened. City kids in Burkina Faso think they've spotted Osama bin Laden. A deaf Frenchwoman in Manhattan writes a Dear John letter to a man who has left that morning for work at the World Trade Center. A Chilean remembers Allende. Events recall other deaths. A mother endures more than her son's death. And so on. The tone varies, as do the locales. Most stories are about others coming to terms with the events of the day, but at least one confronts the viewer with tragedy and death.","Language":"English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, French Sign Language, Japanese","Country":"UK, France, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, USA, Iran","Awards":"3 wins & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxMjI4MjYtNjYzMC00ZTE1LWJlNjAtNWIyYzU3Njc3ODRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"76%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"61/100"}],"Metascore":"61","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"5,387","imdbID":"tt0328802","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
