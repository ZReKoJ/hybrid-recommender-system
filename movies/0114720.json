Having squandered the money that came from his resulting celebrity status, Earl is convinced by the $50,000-a-head bounty offered, as well as the enthusiasm of admirer Grady Hoover, who becomes his partner. At Petromaya, Earl and Grady meet geologist Kate Reilly, and begin Graboid hunting, tricking several Graboids into swallowing bomb-rigged, remote-controlled cars. When they find they're facing a lot more Graboids than they ever expected, Earl calls his friend Burt Gummer, a survivalist who arrives well-stocked with weapons.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI0MjY1NjgtYzI0MS00Yzg4LWIyNzgtZmY4YmJmOTNjYTg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"56%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.0","imdbVotes":"26,111","imdbID":"tt0114720","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Stampede Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
