In China, workers gather outside the factory, exhorted by their team leader to produce more and make fewer errors. A woman assembles a circuit breaker, and women and children are seen picking through debris or playing in it. Burtynsky concludes with a visit to Shanghai, the world's fastest growing city, where wealth and poverty, high-rises and old neighborhoods are side by side.","Language":"English, Cantonese, Mandarin","Country":"Canada","Awards":"4 wins & 7 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUyMzUzNDQ2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc3OTQ1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"79/100"}],"Metascore":"79","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"2,782","imdbID":"tt0832903","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Foundry Films, National Film Board of Canada","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
