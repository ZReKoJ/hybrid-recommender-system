{"Title":"Gummo","Year":"1997","Rated":"R","Released":"24 Nov 1997","Runtime":"89 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Harmony Korine","Writer":"Harmony Korine","Actors":"Jacob Sewell, Nick Sutton, Lara Tosh, Jacob Reynolds","Plot":"Constructing this film through random scenes, director Harmony Korine abruptly jettisoned any sort of narrative plot, so here we go: Solomon and Tummler are two bored teenage boys who live in Xenia, Ohio. A few years ago, a tornado swept through it, destroying more than half the town and killing the same amount, including Solomon's father. The film, from there, chronicles the anti-social adventures these two boys have. These include sniffing glue, killing cats, having sex, riding dirtbikes, listening to black metal, and meeting a cavalcade of quirky, bizarre, and scary people. These include a man who pimps his mentally ill wife to our anti-heroes, three sisters who play with their cat and practice becoming strippers, a black midget fending off the sexual advances of a troubled man (played by the director Harmony Korine), a 12-year-old gay transvestite who is also a cat killer, Solomon's mother who seems to be the only glimpse of sanity, two foul-mouthed six-year olds, and most importantly, a nymphlike skateboarder who walks around town wearing pink rabbit ears.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"4 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NjE4NTU4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkwMDg3NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"36%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"19/100"}],"Metascore":"19","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"31,585","imdbID":"tt0119237","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Independent Pictures, Fine Line Features","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
