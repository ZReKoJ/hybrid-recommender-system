The Bureau, directed by the fierce Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close), enforces a strict family-planning agenda that the sisters outwit by taking turns assuming the identity of one person: Karen Settman. Taught by their grandfather (Willem Dafoe) who raised and named them - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday - each can go outside once a week as their common identity, but are only free to be themselves in the prison of their own apartment. That is until, one day, Monday does not come home.","Language":"English","Country":"UK, France, USA, Belgium","Awards":"1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MDQxMDg3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ0MTcwMzI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"58%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"47/100"}],"Metascore":"47","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"102,571","imdbID":"tt1536537","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
