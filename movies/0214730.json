Anslinger, George Bush, Cab Calloway","Plot":"This film explores the history of the American government's official policy on marijuana in the 20th century. Rising with xenophobia with Mexican immigration and their taste for smoking marijuana, we see the establishment of a wrong headed federal drug policy as a crime issue as opposed to a public health approach. Fueled by prejudice, hysterical propaganda and political opportunism undeterred by voices of reason on the subject, we follow the story of a costly and futile crusade against a substance with debatable ill effects that has damaged basic civil liberties.","Language":"English","Country":"Canada","Awards":"1 win.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MzM5Mjg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE5MjgxMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"75%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"64/100"}],"Metascore":"64","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"3,436","imdbID":"tt0214730","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Sphinx Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
