Down on his luck and struggling to make ends meet, he keeps bashing away, refusing to admit that perhaps he is not that good. One day, at wit's end and feeling sorry for himself, he meets someone who has actually read his book: a rather elegant looking Englishman who introduces himself as Luther Fox. Luther runs an escort agency Elysian Fields, which provides extremely wealthy women with attractive, intelligent dates. Desperate for any job- and Luther guarantees good pay and convinces him that it can be only temporary -Byron reluctantly agrees, keeping the whole thing hidden from his wife. He soon finds himself face-to-face with an extremely attractive woman, whose aging husband is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist grappling with a novel that may be his last. Before long, Byron finds himself immersed in a world that he finds almost impossible to believe and even harder to explain.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxODEyMDA0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTYzNDg5._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"51%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"57/100"}],"Metascore":"57","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"4,050","imdbID":"tt0265307","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"TVA International, Fireworks Pictures, Pfilmco, Gold Circle Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
