{"Title":"Together","Year":"2000","Rated":"R","Released":"21 Sep 2001","Runtime":"106 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Director":"Lukas Moodysson","Writer":"Lukas Moodysson","Actors":"Lisa Lindgren, Michael Nyqvist, Emma Samuelsson, Sam Kessel","Plot":"It is the 70s and a group of very different individuals live together as a community. One of the members sister, Elisabeth needs a new place to stay with her children after having had enough of her alcoholist and abusive husband. Elisabeth is neither a socialist, feminist or into the green movement but ends up loving living in the community where they all learn from eachother. The film makes a little fun of people with strong ideals and \"square\" minds whether they be vegans, communists or people who absolutely disgust vegans or socialists, in the end the message of the film is that people can grow and gain from bonding with eachother. It also shows how we need to shape up a little for this to work, either through working with own behaviour that affects other people badly (like alcoholism or abuse) or the need to set up own boundaries and not let other people walk all over oneself.","Language":"Swedish","Country":"Sweden, Denmark, Italy","Awards":"15 wins & 15 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZjMzBlZTAtYTA1Mi00ZWI2LWI3NjUtMDUzMWJjMGIzMDg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQxNDExNTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"90%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"84/100"}],"Metascore":"84","imdbRating":"7.4","imdbVotes":"20,213","imdbID":"tt0203166","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"TV1000 AB, Nordisk Film- &amp; TV-Fond, Zentropa Entertainments, SVT Drama, Memfis Film, Film i Väst, Swedish Film Institute","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
