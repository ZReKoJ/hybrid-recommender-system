Down-and-out former professional Ping-Pong phenom Randy Daytona is sucked into this maelstrom when FBI Agent Rodriguez recruits him for a secret mission. Randy is determined to bounce back and recapture his former glory, and to smoke out his father's killer - one of the FBI's Most Wanted, arch-fiend Feng. But, after two decades out of the game, Randy can't turn his life around and avenge his father's murder without a team of his own. He calls upon the spiritual guidance of blind Ping-Pong sage and restaurateur Wong, and the training expertise of Master Wong's wildly sexy niece Maggie, both of whom also have a dark history with Feng. All roads lead to Feng's mysterious jungle compound and the most unique Ping-Pong tournaments ever staged. There, Randy faces such formidable players as his long-ago Olympics opponent, the still-vicious Karl Wolfschtagg. Can Randy keep his eye on the ball? Will he achieve the redemption he craves while wielding a paddle? Is his backhand strong enough to triumph over rampant wickedness?","Language":"English, Mandarin","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3MDQ1Mzc4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI0NTc0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"21%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"38/100"}],"Metascore":"38","imdbRating":"5.3","imdbVotes":"40,484","imdbID":"tt0424823","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Spyglass Entertainment, Rogue Pictures","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
