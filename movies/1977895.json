Visiting Chris and handcuffing him to an exposed plumbing pipe, Michael forces his buddy into detox, but while watching over his friend he also discovers that all is not right within the territory Chris has drifted into. Situated on Indian Reservation land, the area seems to attract a number of strange people. Someone or some thing has a longtime interest in recording activities in the area, all captured on a variety of recording devices (CDs, film, phonographs, etc.). Michael comes to understand he's been pulled into the latest \"story\" of an unseen entity, one with a grizzly resolution projected for him and his pal unless they can possibly work out their own agreeable alternate ending.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1OTI0NjcyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc1NzI5OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"80%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"80/100"}],"Metascore":"80","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"13,996","imdbID":"tt1977895","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Tribeca Film Center","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
