A clerk born 11 March 1977 hears her horoscope on the way to work: today she'll meet her true love, but she must be patient. Before the day ends under a full moon, twenty lives intersect time and again in unpredictable, connected ways: a jilted lover holds a souvenir pebble, a stolen coffee maker looks suspicious at a Metro stop, a yellow rain slicker is passed on as a gift, lettuce causes a bicycle accident, a leaf betrays an habitual liar who's just told the truth, and an Algerian waiter, also born 11 March 1977, sees a bug cross a tablecloth. Magical sand from the Sahara is in the air.","Language":"French, English","Country":"France","Awards":"3 wins.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNTUyMTQ0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyOTkxMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"64%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"59/100"}],"Metascore":"59","imdbRating":"6.8","imdbVotes":"3,737","imdbID":"tt0243135","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"20th Century Fox","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
