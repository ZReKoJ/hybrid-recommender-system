Children love her, but the other gorillas-Petunia (Jennette McCurdy), Elvis (Nathan Kress) and Anvil (Keith David)-don't because she's different. With the help of an eccentric red panda named Jenga (David Spade), Snowflake plans a secret mission to sneak out of the zoo and venture into the dangerous city to find the witch at the circus who can help her become a \"normal\" gorilla. Will Snowflake find the cure she's looking for, or realize that there's something more important than fitting in-being true to yourself?","Language":"Catalan, English","Country":"Spain","Awards":"1 win & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAzYTA0YzktYjRmYS00Y2VmLWJkZTYtMzhkYjllNmE4ZmZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0ODMzMzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"4.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"21%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"4.4","imdbVotes":"544","imdbID":"tt1429433","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Filmax","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
