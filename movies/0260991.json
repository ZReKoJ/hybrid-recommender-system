But the 11 bullets found in the bodies, together with the 5 remaining rounds in the assassin's magazine, amount to 16 cartridges for a gun that should normally hold 15. The investigating Swiss/Swedish team from the neutral countries overseeing the DMZ suspects that another, unknown party was involved - all of which points to some sort of cover up. The truth is much simpler and much more tragic.","Language":"Korean, English, German","Country":"South Korea","Awards":"14 wins & 5 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI3NjFlOTktN2JhYy00NjhjLWFmYWYtMDk3ZTkwOWQwZTAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"81%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"58/100"}],"Metascore":"58","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"25,678","imdbID":"tt0260991","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Warner Brothers/Seven Arts","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
