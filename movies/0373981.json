Bulcsú's (Sándor Csányi) life that once was, on the surface, where the real people go home after work, who go to the movies or a fine restaurant is now replaced by the dark, cold and solitude arena of his new dwellings. He, and his motley crew of ragtag metro ticket Kontrollers must patrol the trains that run these City dwellers back and forth and with daily ritual, check that no one dare come down into their world for a free ride. With indifferent passengers, a possible love interest, a regime set on competition and to top it all a mysterious serial killer at large, Kontroll is a dark and bleak comedy of the world of the ticket inspector, who, in the end must keep this Metro system running. If not, what would be the worst that could happen, if they ever lost control? Dare you ride here for free, too?","Language":"Hungarian","Country":"Hungary","Awards":"19 wins & 5 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3Nzk5MTE4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEwODgyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"82%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"72/100"}],"Metascore":"72","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"24,159","imdbID":"tt0373981","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Bonfire","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
