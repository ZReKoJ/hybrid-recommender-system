He talks about an old lady and her pet, living in Manhattan, experiencing his body's aging (he's 45), men's fascination with women's breasts, the beauty of living outside the food chain, his quickness to anger while driving, and murder. It's theater in the round, so he's in constant motion, a grin nearly always on his face.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"Won 1 Primetime Emmy.
