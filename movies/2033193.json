At Hogwarts, Professor Quirrell, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, reinstates an old tournament, the House Cup. Four students, one from Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin and Gryffindor are chosen as the 'champions' and have to perform in life-threatening tasks in order to win the House Cup. However, Quirrell is under the command of the evil Lord Voldemort and is helping Voldemort return to his own body, rather than being attached to Quirrells soul.
