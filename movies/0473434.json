Every seven years, Michael Apted visits them. At 49, 12 agree to talk about family, work, their hopes, and the series. We also see footage from previous interviews. Some marriages seem stronger; some have ended. Being a parent or a grandparent dominates life's pleasures. Simon has found responsibility; John's charity work flourishes. Neil remains in politics, against all odds. Jackie leads the critique of a more deliberately-present Apted and the series' intrusiveness. None enjoy participating; all are reflective; several surpass expectations.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"6 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNjQ3MTAyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg4MTkzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"97%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"84/100"}],"Metascore":"84","imdbRating":"8.2","imdbVotes":"2,576","imdbID":"tt0473434","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
