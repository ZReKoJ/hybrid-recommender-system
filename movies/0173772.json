They had a powerful effect on me. You should see them.\" That's Martin Scorsese's message for this documentary. We meet his family on Elizabeth Street in New York; he's a third generation Italian with Sicilian roots. Starting in 1949, they watched movies on TV as well as in theaters, lots of Italian imports. Scorsese, with his narration giving a personal as well as a public context, shows extended clips of these movies. Films of Rossellini and De Sica fill part one; those of Visconti, Fellini, and Antonioni comprise part two. Scorsese takes time with emotion, style, staging, technique, political context, and cinematic influence. It's his movie family.","Language":"English, Italian, French, German","Country":"Italy, USA","Awards":"3 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRkM2RiZWYtODYxNy00ZmJlLTkyZDQtNDdiNTIwMzkxYzQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIwNDY4NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"90/100"}],"Metascore":"90","imdbRating":"8.2","imdbVotes":"2,984","imdbID":"tt0173772","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
