So the Home Research Institute sent out eighteen observers to a rural district of Norway to map out the kitchen routines of single men. The researchers were on twenty-four-hour call, and sat in special strategically placed chairs in each kitchen. Furthermore, under no circumstances were the researchers to be spoken to, or included in the kitchen activities.","Language":"Norwegian, Swedish","Country":"Norway, Sweden","Awards":"8 wins & 6 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNjEwNTc5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE3MjcyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"91%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"75/100"}],"Metascore":"75","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"7,842","imdbID":"tt0323872","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"BOB Film Sweden AB, Bulbul Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
