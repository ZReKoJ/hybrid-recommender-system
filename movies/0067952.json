The brutal Vic cuts the throat of one bloke who has been a little too loose-lipped, afraid that his gossiping may turn into a grand operatic performance for the coppers. Vic, who enjoys playing at rough trade with his sidekick Wolfe, plans a payroll robbery and directs the blackmailing of Members of Parliament with a taste for unorthodox sex. Scotland Yard Police Inspector Matthews, playing Javert to Vic's Jean Valjean, is moving in on him and the gang. Gang-member Edgar is hospitalized for an ulcer, and Inspector Matthews might be able to make him sing. Will Edgar spill the beans to the coppers before Vic can silence him?","Language":"English","Country":"UK, USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDgzZTBkYjctMGZmNC00MjhlLWFjYjYtMWJjYTgyNTExZGI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"64%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"1,364","imdbID":"tt0067952","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Anglo-EMI","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
