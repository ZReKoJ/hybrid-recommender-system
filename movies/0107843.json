However, top-secret US government agent 'Bob' arranges a staged death, so Maggie can be elaborately trained as a killer. She gets a new cover identity as saleswoman Claudia Anne Doran. She also finds a house-mate, building super J.P., a broad-minded, gentle photographer. The two fall in love, and that complicates her government assignments. His influence extends to breeding in her a conscience that supplants her violent tendencies and desire to continue work for the agency.","Language":"English, French","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwY2I3YmEtYWI1Ny00MjQyLThiNDUtZWI2NTI5YjJjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"50%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.1","imdbVotes":"24,819","imdbID":"tt0107843","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Art Linson Productions, Warner Bros.","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
