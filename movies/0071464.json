She likes him because he's taught her much, and he likes her because she's learning so well - and wants to often. Both are very tolerant in matters of extramarital affairs, so he doesn't mind the young Marie-Ange coming over every so often, although she obviously wants more than talk from his wife. But Emmanuelle is more fascinated by the older Bee, and joins her on a trip into the jungle.","Language":"French","Country":"France","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTNhMWRiM2YtZmUwYy00MzBjLWIzMjktNTk0NDEwNWE2Zjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"40%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.3","imdbVotes":"9,186","imdbID":"tt0071464","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
