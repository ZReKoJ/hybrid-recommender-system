Infamous for his bravado and outrageously daring prison escapes, Mesrine carried out numerous robberies, kidnappings and murders in a criminal career that spanned continents until he was shot dead in 1979 by France's notorious anti-gang unit. Thirty years after his death, his infamy lives on. Mesrine was helped along the way by beautiful and equally reckless Jeanne Schneider (CÃ©cile de France), a Bonnie to match his Clyde. Mesrine made up his own epic, between romanticism and cruelty, flamboyance and tragedy.","Language":"French, English, Arabic, Spanish","Country":"France, Canada, Italy","Awards":"8 wins & 15 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZhNWEwMDAtYzEyOC00NTVkLTgxZDktYjQwMDJiYjk2NmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODAwMTU1MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"82%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"71/100"}],"Metascore":"71","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"31,801","imdbID":"tt1259014","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Téléfilm Canada, Région Haute-Normandie, Cinémage 2, Novo RPI, La Petite Reine, Banque Populaire Images 8, Remstar Productions, 120 Films, M6 Films, Angoa-Agicoa, Uni Étoile 5, Société de Développement des Entreprises Culturelles (SODEC), Uni Etoile 4, Procirep, Canal+, Centre National de la Cinematographie, TPS Star","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
