Larry Kelly, a producer friend, offers her to sing \"Carmen\" in a televised concert. Unfortunately Maria's voice, tired and worn by years and strain, is not what it used to be. Larry knows the way around the problem : a technical stratagem will create the illusion. Maria, disregarding her friend Sarah's warning, agrees with the idea and the show is a tremendous success. With that in mind, Larry now considers a new version of \"Tosca\". But this time, Maria objects to the subterfuge. Her decision will mark the beginning of the end for the legendary singer.","Language":"English, French, Italian, Spanish","Country":"Italy, France, Spain, UK, Romania","Awards":"2 wins & 4 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE3YjgzNDItMWJjMy00ZmYxLTk2ZjgtOWM5M2UwODI4Y2NkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjgyNjk3MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"49/100"}],"Metascore":"49","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"2,101","imdbID":"tt0274407","Type":"movie","DVD":"08 May 2007","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
