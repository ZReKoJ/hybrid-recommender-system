The events of the night in inner city Atlanta, Georgia, unfold in real time as we inter-cut between a carjacking and the beginning of that day, following four separate kids - who they are, where they come from, and the seemingly innocuous decisions that lead them towards a life changing conclusion. With no adults to guide them, they're left on their own to try to survive not only this night, but the complex reality of the world they live in.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"7 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNjQ2ODM5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM3NDk1Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"47%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"51/100"}],"Metascore":"51","imdbRating":"5.7","imdbVotes":"3,171","imdbID":"tt1641385","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Perfect Weekend","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
