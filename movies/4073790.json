Those who survived the disease were left with unnatural powers that could only be described by a color: the greens (super intelligent), the blues (telekinesis), the yellows (control over electricity), the oranges (power over the mind), and the reds (control fire). Ruby is an orange, a dangerous one. She is sent to Thurmond, a camp for kids like her. She is miserable there and scared of what happened to the others like her. She hides under the facade that she is a green and watched as those like her are taken away. She escapes this horrible place with the help of the children's league, and from there her life changes forever.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxOGE3OTUtM2I2My00YzE3LTg2NDktZTI3NjE4NDdjMGFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"16%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"39/100"}],"Metascore":"39","imdbRating":"5.7","imdbVotes":"27,624","imdbID":"tt4073790","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"21 Laps Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
