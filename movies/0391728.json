Then Adam meets Eve, starts falling in love, but gets jealous of frat-brother Billy, who 'bumps' almost constantly without seeking love, while Eve guards her campus-unique virginity. As even his thrice-divorced dad, an MD, urges Adam to get laid rather then loved, his patience runs out against healthy hormones.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NDE5Nzk0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY4OTEzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"4.4/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"4.4","imdbVotes":"2,665","imdbID":"tt0391728","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Feb 2006","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"TLA Releasing","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
