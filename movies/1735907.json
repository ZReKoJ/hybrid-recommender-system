{"Title":"The Adderall Diaries","Year":"2015","Rated":"R","Released":"10 Mar 2016","Runtime":"87 min","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Director":"Pamela Romanowsky","Writer":"Pamela Romanowsky, Stephen Elliott (based on the book by)","Actors":"James Franco, Ed Harris, Amber Heard, Jim Parrack","Plot":"As a writer stymied by past success, writers block, substance abuse, relationship problems and a serious set of father issues, Elliott's cracked-out chronicle of a bizarre murder trial amounts to less than the sum of its parts. Not long into the 2007 trial of programmer Hans Reiser, accused of murdering his wife, the defendant's friend Sean Sturgeon obliquely confessed to several murders (though not the murder of Reiser's wife). Elliott, caught up in the film-ready twist and his tenuous connection to Sturgeon (they share a BDSM social circle), makes a gonzo record of the proceedings. The result is a scattered, self-indulgent romp through the mind of a depressive narcissist obsessed with his insecurities and childhood traumas.","Language":"Spanish, English","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE1OWEyOTYtNjRlYy00MDhiLWE1NzMtNjc0MmZkZjQyZWY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc0MjUzMzU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"23%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"42/100"}],"Metascore":"42","imdbRating":"5.2","imdbVotes":"4,319","imdbID":"tt1735907","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
