{"Title":"The Trials of Henry Kissinger","Year":"2002","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"07 May 2003","Runtime":"80 min","Genre":"Documentary","Director":"Eugene Jarecki","Writer":"Alex Gibney, Christopher Hitchens (book)","Actors":"Brian Cox, Henry Kissinger, Anna Chennault, Amy Goodman","Plot":"Part contemporary investigation and part historical inquiry, documentary follows the quest of one journalist in search of justice. The film focuses on Christopher Hitchens' charges against Henry Kissinger as a war criminal - allegations documented in Hitchens' book of the same title - based on his role in countries such as Cambodia, Chile, and Indonesia. Kissinger's story raises profound questions about American foreign policy and highlights a new era of human rights. Increasing evidence about one man's role in a long history of human rights abuses leads to a critical examination of American diplomacy through the lens of international standards of justice.","Language":"English","Country":"USA, UK, Denmark, France, Canada, Australia","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEyOTEwMjc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc3MTQyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"95%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"72/100"}],"Metascore":"72","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"1,869","imdbID":"tt0326306","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Jigsaw Educational Productions Inc., Think Tank Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
