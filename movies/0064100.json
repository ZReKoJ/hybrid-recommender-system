Returning to their Los Angeles home, the newly \"enlightened\" couple chastise their closest friends, Ted and Alice, for not coming to grips with their true feelings. Bob insists that everyone \"feel\" rather than intellectualize their emotions, and Carol pronounces \"that's beautiful\" after anyone says anything even remotely personal. Ted and Alice humor their friends, but it is obvious that there is a good-natured sexual tension at work within the foursome.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"Nominated for 4 Oscars.
