His whole body, even his arms and legs, are entirely man-made. What only remains are traces of his brain and the memories of a woman. In an era when the boundary between humans and machines has become infinitely vague, Humans have forgotten that they are humans. This is the debauchery of the lonesome ghost of a man, who nevertheless seeks to retain humanity. Innocence... Is what life is.","Language":"Japanese, Cantonese, English","Country":"Japan","Awards":"6 wins & 8 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjlkYWVlMjQtMGY3Zi00MWYxLTkxYTItODBkNGUyOWJjMjhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIyNzY1NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"64%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"66/100"}],"Metascore":"66","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"35,834","imdbID":"tt0347246","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Kodansha Ltd., Dentsu, Bandai Visual Co.
