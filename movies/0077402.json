Taking stock of their surroundings, they arm themselves, lock down the mall, and destroy the zombies inside so they can eke out a living--at least for a while. Tensions begin to build as months go on, and they come to realize that they've fallen prey to consumerism. Soon afterward, they have even heavier problems to worry about, as a large gang of bikers discovers the mall and invades it, ruining the survivors' best-laid plans and forcing them to fight off both lethal bandits and flesh-eating zombies.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"USA, Italy","Awards":"2 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc1YTIyNjctYzhlNy00ZmYzLWI2ZWQtMzk4MmQwYzA0NGQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"94%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"71/100"}],"Metascore":"71","imdbRating":"7.9","imdbVotes":"110,542","imdbID":"tt0077402","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
