During the town's annual 4th of July Crab Festival, townspeople become sick, exhibiting a variety of symptoms, which leads local news reporters to suspect something has infected the water there. No one is sure what it is or how it's transmitted, but as people start to behave strangely, and others turning up dead, fear spawns into panic. The town is shut down as government authorities confiscate video footage from every media or personal source they find, in an effort to cover-up the incident. But one local reporter who witnessed the epidemic, was able to document, assemble, and hide this film in hopes that one day, the horrible truth would be revealed . . .","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyMDY1YTktNWNjMC00MGNmLWEwMGMtMzIxZjQ1ODQ4MjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzMzMjU5NDY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"76%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"65/100"}],"Metascore":"65","imdbRating":"5.6","imdbVotes":"24,948","imdbID":"tt1713476","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Haunted Movies","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
