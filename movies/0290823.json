Just as an electoral urn is being parachuted from the sky, a young woman disembarks on the beach. To the soldier's bafflement, it turns out that she is in charge of the mobile electoral seat and voting on the islands; therefore the soldier is obliged to obey her orders and escort her with his rifle and army jeep across the desert, where the woman obstinately intends to collect the votes. During the day, stressed by a series of absurd events, the two learn to get to know each other. At sunset, when the young woman leaves, the man realizes that the secret vote contained much more than he had ever imagined.","Language":"Persian","Country":"Iran, Italy, Canada, Switzerland","Awards":"10 wins & 5 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMTQ0MzA3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc3OTQxMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"82%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"75/100"}],"Metascore":"75","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"1,141","imdbID":"tt0290823","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
