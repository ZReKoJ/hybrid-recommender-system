He's forced to teach autocracy for the school's project week. He's less than enthusiastic at first, but the response of the students is surprising to say the least. He forces the students to become more invested in the prospect of self rule, and soon the class project has its own power and eerily starts to resemble Germany's past. Can Wegner and his class realize what's happening before the horrors start repeating themselves?","Language":"German","Country":"Germany, France","Awards":"9 wins & 8 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc0ZmUyZjAtZThkMi00ZDY5LTg5YjctYmUwM2FiYjMyMDI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"67%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"101,423","imdbID":"tt1063669","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
