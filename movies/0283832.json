But there will be no celebration at all because their beloved patriarch has been murdered! The killer can only be one of the eight women closest to the man of the house. Was it his powerful wife? His spinster sister-in-law? His miserly mother-in-law? Maybe the insolent chambermaid or the loyal housekeeper? Could it possibly have been one of his two young daughters? A surprise visit from the victim's chic sister sends the household into a tizzy, encouraging hysterics, exacerbating rivalries, and encompassing musical interludes. Comedic situations arise with the revelations of dark family secrets. Seduction dances with betrayal. The mystery of the female psyche is revealed. There are eight women and each is a suspect. Each has a motive. Each has a secret. Beautiful, tempestuous, intelligent, sensual, and dangerous...one of them is guilty. Which one is it?","Language":"French, English","Country":"France, Italy","Awards":"11 wins & 31 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJkYTg4N2MtMzcwMy00ZjFiLWFlNzItMmJhMTllZjI2YjRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzA5NjUyNjM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"79%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"64/100"}],"Metascore":"64","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"28,881","imdbID":"tt0283832","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Fidélité Productions, B.I.M., Le Studio Canal +, France 2 Cinema, Centre National de la Cinematographie","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
