Unfortunately the story moves so quickly into the sensationalized decadence and drug-induced state of Jones, that the unknowing viewer has to wonder why anyone would care. There are only a few framing sequences with members of The Stones, particularly Keith Richards, that show they had a great respect for him and tried to bring him back into the band as he drifted away. Mixed into the destruction of Jones is a common builder, Frank Thorogood, who is given the unenviable task of trying to please Jones by rebuilding his estate and to watch him per Jones' manager's instructions. Thorogood's life is so far removed from all of the sex and drugs that he sees, that he envies and desires the tawdry life as well, but never quite fits in. Unfortunately, at least according to this film and according to a supposed death bed confessional of Thorogood in 1993, it led to Thorogood's murder of Jones in a swimming pool \"accident\".","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"4 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWIxZTIyZjgtNmM1ZS00ZTI0LWJlMTktNDUyMjM2MzQ4ZmVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ5MzY0NjM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"14%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"41/100"}],"Metascore":"41","imdbRating":"5.8","imdbVotes":"3,835","imdbID":"tt0426627","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Audley Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
