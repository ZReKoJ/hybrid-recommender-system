After a chance encounter, they embark on an explosive journey of sex and murder. Perhaps as a revenge against men, perhaps as a revolt against bourgeois society, but certainly in a negation - almost joyful in its senseless violence - of all the codes of a society which has excluded, raped and humiliated them. Controversial for its violence and real sex scenes: a vividly nihilist road movie set in France.","Language":"French","Country":"France","Awards":"3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MzMxMzM5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDk0MTk4._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"4.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"23%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"35/100"}],"Metascore":"35","imdbRating":"4.4","imdbVotes":"16,611","imdbID":"tt0249380","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Pan Européenne Production, Take One, Toute Premiere Fois, Le Studio Canal +","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
