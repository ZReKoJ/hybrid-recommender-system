Inspired by the death of four family members from \"legal drugs\" Texas filmmaker Kevin Booth sets out to discover why the Drug War has become such a big failure. Three and a half years in the making the film follows gang members, former DEA agents, CIA officers, narcotics officers, judges, politicians, prisoners and celebrities. Most notably the film befriends Freeway Ricky Ross; the man many accuse for starting the Crack epidemic, who after being arrested discovered that his cocaine source had been working for the CIA. AMERICAN DRUG WAR shows how money, power and greed have corrupted not just dope fiends but an entire government. More importantly, it shows what can be done about it. This is not some 'pro-drug' stoner film, but a collection of expert testimonials from the ground troops on the front lines of the drug war, the ones who are fighting it and the ones who are living it.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NjM2NjM0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE0MTM1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"86%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"1,566","imdbID":"tt1033467","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Sacred Cow Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
