He often teams up with Frenchman Jean Laurier, alias \"Scorpio\", a gifted free-lance operative. One day, the CIA orders Scorpio to eliminate Cross -- and leaves him no choice but to obey. Scorpio is cold-blooded and very systematic; however, as a veteran agent, Cross knows many tricks. He can also rely upon a network of unusual personal contacts, some dating back to the troubled years preceding WWII. A lethal game of hide-and-seek is programmed, but what are the true motives of every single player?","Language":"English, French, German","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM4ZTI0ZmItY2VjZi00MzI4LTlhYTAtYjg2NzJlNGE1N2U0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"67%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"3,961","imdbID":"tt0070653","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Mirisch Corporation","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
