The film's attempted biography matches many public myths surrounding Cole at the time, despite its lack of relationship with truth. For instance, truth and movie are different in regards to: his sex life (he was a gay man in a marriage of convenience with a divorcee friend), his relationship with his wife, Monty Wooley was a contemporary (not Professor), and his French military experience was a hoax.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3MTY5NzUtMjJiYS00MDNlLThjZGYtNmVkYzU5NTA1N2U4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"60%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"2,632","imdbID":"tt0038776","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Warner Brothers","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
