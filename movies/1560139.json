Here we meet Boy, an 11-year-old who lives on a farm with his gran, a goat, and his younger brother, Rocky (who thinks he has magic powers). Shortly after Gran leaves for a week, Boy's father, Alamein, appears out of the blue. Having imagined a heroic version of his father during his absence, Boy comes face to face with the real version-an incompetent hoodlum who has returned to find a bag of money he buried years before. This is where the goat enters.","Language":"English, Maori","Country":"New Zealand","Awards":"13 wins & 9 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4MjQ2ODQyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE0NzIzNw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"87%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"70/100"}],"Metascore":"70","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"21,743","imdbID":"tt1560139","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
