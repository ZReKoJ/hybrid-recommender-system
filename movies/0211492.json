Discovering his prodigious talent in boyhood overshadowed by his parents' failing marriage, Luzhin's lyrical passion for chess has become his refuge and rendered the real world a phantom. Already matched up by her family to the very suitable Comte de Stassard, when Natalia meets Luzhin, she is drawn to the erratic genius and offers him a glimpse outside of his chess obsession. But it is a world he is not equipped to deal with and his two worlds collide to tragic effect.","Language":"English, Italian","Country":"UK, France","Awards":"3 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzOTYyNDY0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ5MjcyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"58%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"64/100"}],"Metascore":"64","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"4,069","imdbID":"tt0211492","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"ICE3, Renaissance Films, Clear Blue Sky Productions, Magic Média, Lantia Cinema, France 2 Cinema","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
