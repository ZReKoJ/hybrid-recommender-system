Volunteering to drive the woman's son home for Thanksgiving to Chicago from his boarding school in Georgia, little does Dutch expect the picaresque adventures in store for him. When a blunt, down-to-earth construction worker takes to the road with an insufferable twelve-year-old snob (desperately insecure under the surface) who does not approve of him in the least, quite a little must happen before they can reach their destination as friends -- or, for that matter, get home at all.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmMzY2FhOTgtNjA1OC00ODIyLTgzNWYtMjMwNzUxZDA3NmY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwMjk0MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"17%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.5","imdbVotes":"11,429","imdbID":"tt0101786","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Twentieth Century Fox, Hughes Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
