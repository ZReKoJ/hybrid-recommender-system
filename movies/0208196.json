Her current lover, Sam Deed, seems different: he's sweet, tender, just in from Dubuque. But, as Ruby tells her therapist about Sam, in flashbacks we see someone not quite of this world. In fact, Sam informs Ruby that he's from the future, 2470 to be exact. Ruby's sure he's delusional, but most of the time she wants to keep him - and maybe fix him. Although he seems sane, maybe Sam hasn't told her the real story: what's he up to, and who is Chrystie Delancey?","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyNDY2ODg3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ0Mjk3OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"70%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"60/100"}],"Metascore":"60","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"9,441","imdbID":"tt0208196","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Independent Film Channel, Accidental Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
