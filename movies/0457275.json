Released from experimentation by the creatures, they go their separate ways. Fifteen years later, Cody, Duke and Otis have re-united; ardent in that revenge is the path to take. Wyatt, however, has ultimately decided to live with the past and has chosen a normal life with his wife Hope. Entwined to the fate of Duke, Cody and Otis when they manage to track down and capture a lone alien, Wyatt and Hope are now thrust into a new world of terror as the horrifying abilities of the creature become known. From hypnotizing Hope with a mere glance into her eyes to infecting Cody with a seemingly transmogrification-bound alien virus, the creature is out to wreak havoc upon its captors in any and all of its devious and insidious means. With no more than a few hours to decide between releasing the creature and forfeiting their lives, and killing the creature condemning the human race, Wyatt may just be the only hope for his friends and his species alike.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFmYjgwZTktMTcwNS00M2QzLWI1YzItY2UxYjQxZjUwOGIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"43%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.6","imdbVotes":"9,930","imdbID":"tt0457275","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Haxan Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
