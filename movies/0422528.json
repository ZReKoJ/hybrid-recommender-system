{"Title":"Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic","Year":"2005","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"09 Dec 2005","Runtime":"72 min","Genre":"Documentary, Comedy, Music","Director":"Liam Lynch","Writer":"Sarah Silverman","Actors":"Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn, Laura Silverman, Bob Odenkirk","Plot":"Sarah Silverman appears before an audience in Los Angeles with several sketches, taped outside the theater, intercut into the stand-up performance. Themes include race, sex, and religion. Her comic persona is a self-centered hipster, brash and clueless about her political incorrectness. A handful of musical numbers punctuate the performance. It begins and ends with her in conversation with two friends: at the start, she's the loser compared to their recent artistic successes; by the end, she's the star, in her dressing room, dismissive and cutting.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxOTUzOTU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE4ODUzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"65%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"63/100"}],"Metascore":"63","imdbRating":"6.5","imdbVotes":"5,283","imdbID":"tt0422528","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
