This film focuses on the flock of cherry-headed conures (and a lonely blue-headed one named Connor) who flock around the Telegraph Hill region of the city and their closest human companion, Mark Bittner . Through his own words, we learn of his life as a frustrated, homeless musician and how he came to live in the area where he decided to explore the nature around him. That lead him to discovering the parrot flock and the individual personalities of it. In a cinematic portrait, we are introduced to his colorful companions and the relationship they share as well as the realities of urban wild life that would change Bittner's life forever.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYyODY0ODk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU2OTgyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"95%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"80/100"}],"Metascore":"80","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"2,923","imdbID":"tt0424565","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
