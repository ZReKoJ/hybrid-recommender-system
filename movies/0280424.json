She's also a self-described sexorexic - she hasn't had sex with a man in four years and has never had a \"mental orgasm.\" She gets plenty of advice - from her publicist, from her best friends (a married couple), from her parents, and from a priest to whom she goes to confession - so there's lots of conflicting emotion and analysis when she starts dating Matthew Starr, a good-looking playboy who's a popular L.A. male-chauvinist-pig radio shock jock. Each of Amy's theories and rules is put to the test - people may not change, but can love work?","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI2NTQ4MzUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQxODEzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"27%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"36/100"}],"Metascore":"36","imdbRating":"5.2","imdbVotes":"1,657","imdbID":"tt0280424","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Serious Dan, Without a Box","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
