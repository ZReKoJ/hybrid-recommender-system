This year, he takes a shortcut. It's the biggest mistake of his life: The nightmare begins. A mysterious woman in white wanders through the forest, leaving death in her wake. A terrifying black car - its driver invisible - carries the victims into the heart of the night. Every road sign points to a destination they never reach. The survivors succumb to panic, to madness; deeply buried secrets burst to the surface, and Christmas turns into a living hell.","Language":"English","Country":"France","Awards":"7 wins & 5 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM2YWZhMjktMDk5My00YzMxLTk5ZDAtNmM0NTkyMDZmMWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"75%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"25,823","imdbID":"tt0308152","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
