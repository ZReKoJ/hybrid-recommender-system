A beleaguered church, deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights to transport an accused witch to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight, a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force.","Language":"English, Latin","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc3MjYxNzg2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQyMTkwNA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"11%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"28/100"}],"Metascore":"28","imdbRating":"5.4","imdbVotes":"89,780","imdbID":"tt0479997","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Atlas Entertainment, Relativity","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
