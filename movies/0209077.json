{"Title":"Ken Park","Year":"2002","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"03 Apr 2003","Runtime":"93 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"Larry Clark, Edward Lachman","Writer":"Harmony Korine (screenplay), Larry Clark (based on stories and characters by)","Actors":"Adam Chubbuck, James Bullard, Seth Gray, Eddie Daniels","Plot":"Ken Park focuses on several teenagers and their tormented home lives. Shawn seems to be the most conventional. Tate is brimming with psychotic rage; Claude is habitually harassed by his brutish father and coddled, rather uncomfortably, by his enormously pregnant mother. Peaches looks after her devoutly religious father, but yearns for freedom. They're all rather tight, or so they claim. But they spend precious little time together and none of them seems to know much about one another's family lives. This bizarre dichotomy underscores their alienation # the result of suburban ennui, a teenager's inherent sense of melodrama, and the disturbing nature of their home environments.","Language":"English","Country":"USA, Netherlands, France","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU4ZTVjMmMtYmY2My00YmQxLTliODItYWVlMzFlMWYwZjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ4NDY5OTc@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"43%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.9","imdbVotes":"28,633","imdbID":"tt0209077","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Busy Bee Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
