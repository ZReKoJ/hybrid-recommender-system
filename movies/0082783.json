Gregory, a theater director from New York, is the more talkative of the pair. He relates to Shawn his tales of dropping out, traveling around the world, and experiencing the variety of ways people live, such as a monk who could balance his entire weight on his fingertips. Shawn listens avidly, but questions the value of Gregory's seeming abandonment of the pragmatic aspects of life.","Language":"English, French","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 wins.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFlMjNlZWUtMTYzNy00ZjA4LWE2YTItOGE3NWVjZDBhOWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"83/100"}],"Metascore":"83","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"18,015","imdbID":"tt0082783","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Saga, The Andre Company","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
