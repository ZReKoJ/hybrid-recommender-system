Compelled by the staggering amount of power that the MPAA ratings board wields, the filmmaker seeks out the true identities of the anonymous elite who control what films make it to the multiplex. He even goes so far as to hire a private investigator to stake out MPAA headquarters and expose Hollywood's best-kept secret. Along the way, Dick speaks with numerous filmmakers whose careers have been affected by the seemingly random and sexual-content obsessed judgments of the MPAA, including John Waters, Mary Harron, Darren Aronofsky, Kevin Smith, Matt Stone, and Atom Egoyan.","Language":"English","Country":"UK, USA","Awards":"3 wins & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDIwMDUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY3MzIzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"75/100"}],"Metascore":"75","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"27,255","imdbID":"tt0493459","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"IFC Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
