{"Title":"HyperNormalisation","Year":"2016","Rated":"N/A","Released":"16 Oct 2016","Runtime":"166 min","Genre":"Documentary","Director":"Adam Curtis","Writer":"Adam Curtis","Actors":"Adam Curtis, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Victor Gotbaum","Plot":"HyperNormalisation tells the extraordinary story of how we got to this strange time of great uncertainty and confusion - where those who are supposed to be in power are paralysed - and have no idea what to do. And, where events keep happening that seem inexplicable and out of control - from Donald Trump to Brexit, the War in Syria, the endless migrant crisis, and random bomb attacks. It explains not only why these chaotic events are happening - but also why we, and our politicians, cannot understand them. The film shows that what has happened is that all of us in the West - not just the politicians and the journalists and the experts, but we ourselves - have retreated into a simplified, and often completely fake version of the world. But because it is all around us, we accept it as normal.
