{"Title":"Ro.Go.Pa.G.","Year":"1963","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"19 Feb 1963","Runtime":"122 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Jean-Luc Godard, Ugo Gregoretti, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Roberto Rossellini","Writer":"Roberto Rossellini, Jean-Luc Godard, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Ugo Gregoretti","Actors":"Rosanna Schiaffino, Bruce Balaban, Maria Pia Schiaffino, Jean-Marc Bory","Plot":"This consists of four short films by different directors. Rosselini's 'Chastity' ('Illibatezza') deals with an attractive air hostess who receives the unwelcome attentions of a middle aged American. Godard's 'New World' ('Il Nuovo Mondo') illustrates a post-apocalypse world the same as the pre-apocalyptic one but for an enigmatic change in attitude in most people, including the central character's girlfriend. In Pasolini's 'Curd Cheese' ('La Ricotta'), a lavish film about the life of Jesus Christ is being made in a poor area. The impoverished people subject themselves to various indignities in the name of moviemaking in order to win a little food. The central character is hoisted up on a cross for filming, and dies there. Finally comes Gregoretti's 'Free Range Chicken' ('Il Pollo Ruspante') in which a family of the materialist culture inadvertantly illustrate the cynical, metallic voiced doctrine of a top sales theorist.","Language":"Italian","Country":"Italy, France","Awards":"1 win.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY5N2M3NjgtNzdkMS00NDczLTgwZDktNWM0YTNlZjVkZjAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIzNDU1NTY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"80%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"1,570","imdbID":"tt0056171","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
