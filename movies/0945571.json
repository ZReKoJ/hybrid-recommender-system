A bright light from a spacecraft shines through a bedroom window and lifts a sleeping man. However, the light and the small alien controlling it from the ship are unable to pull the man through the window: first it's the glass that impedes them. The alien frets; its supervisor - large, laconic, and green - watches. As the human keeps sleeping, the alien's tries every lever. Just as it looks as if the alien abduction will succeed, something goes wrong. The supervisor steps in.","Language":"None","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQxMTE5YjItMzA3Ni00MDQ1LWE2MWItM2ZjYWI1Y2I1NDFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTE1NjY5Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"17,845","imdbID":"tt0945571","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
