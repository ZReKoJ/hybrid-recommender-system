Stallman, Eric Raymond, Bruce Perens","Plot":"While Microsoft may be the biggest software company in the world, not every computer user is a fan of their products, or their way of doing business. While Microsoft's Windows became the most widely used operating system for personal computers in the world, many experts took issue with Microsoft's strict policies regarding licensing, ownership, distribution, and alteration of their software. The objections of many high-profile technology experts, most notably Richard Stallman, led to what has become known as \"the Open Source Movement,\" which is centered on the belief that computer software should be free both in the economic and intellectual senses of the word. Eventually, one of Stallman's admirers, Linus Torvalds, created a new operating system called Linux, a freely distributed software which many programmers consider to be markedly superior to Windows. Revolution OS is a documentary that examines the genesis of the Open Source Movement, and explores and explains the technical and intellectual issues involved in a manner understandable to computer aficionados and non-techheads alike.","Language":"English, Swedish","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyNDU0NTIwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE4MDQyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"43%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"46/100"}],"Metascore":"46","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"2,373","imdbID":"tt0308808","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
