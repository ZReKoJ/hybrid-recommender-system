{"Title":"Craig Ferguson: I'm Here to Help","Year":"2013","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"15 Mar 2013","Runtime":"81 min","Genre":"Documentary, Comedy","Director":"Jay Chapman","Writer":"Craig Ferguson, Jonathan Morano, Ted Mulkerin, Megan Ferguson","Actors":"Craig Ferguson","Plot":"Craig Ferguson wants to tell a joke. And he'll try to finish the joke. But he may not remember to get to the punchline, because he's distracted by hysterical thoughts of fatherhood, Helen of Troy, and shark penises. The host of CBS's The Late Late Show unleashes his trademark stream-of-consciousness comedy before a sold-out Washington, DC crowd. Definitely not for children. Or the easily offended. Or Mel Gibson.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3NzQ0NzE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkxOTE3NDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"749","imdbID":"tt2523852","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
