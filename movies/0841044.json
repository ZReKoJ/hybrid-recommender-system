Their trip to Venice didn't really work out, - they both came down with gastroenteritis. They have higher hopes for Paris. But the combination of Marion's overbearing non-English-speaking parents, flirtatious ex-boyfriends, and Jack's obsession with photographing every famous Parisian tombstone and conviction that French condoms are too small, only adds fuel to the fire. Will they be able to salvage their relationship? Will they ever have sex again? Or will they merely manage to perfect the art of arguing?","Language":"English, French","Country":"France, Germany","Awards":"2 wins & 5 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTY3NTcyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyMjM1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"88%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"67/100"}],"Metascore":"67","imdbRating":"6.8","imdbVotes":"29,993","imdbID":"tt0841044","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Tempête Sous un Crâne, Backup Media, Polaris Film, 3L Filmproduktion, Polaris Productions, Rézo Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
