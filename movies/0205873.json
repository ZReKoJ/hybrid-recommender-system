That the Aussies placed the satellite dish smack dab in the middle of an Australian sheep farm in the boondocks town of Parkes was just one of the reasons that NASA was concerned. Based on a true story, The Dish takes a smart, witty, comical look at the differing cultural attitudes between Australia and the U.S. while revisiting one of the greatest events in history.","Language":"English","Country":"Australia","Awards":"3 wins & 10 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MDc0ODkzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzY5Nzc5._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"96%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"74/100"}],"Metascore":"74","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"15,219","imdbID":"tt0205873","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Dish Film Ltd., Working Dog Productions, Village Roadshow Pictures, Distant Horizon","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
