It was a big leap for me.\"The show, taped at the Paramount Theater in Madison Square Garden and winner of the 1992 CableACE Award, is a perfect blend of biting social commentary and more gently-observed observational pieces.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy.
