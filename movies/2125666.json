To enjoy their good life, he and his engineer turned beauty queen trophy wife, Jackie, were building the largest single family private home in America. Suddenly, both the US economy and Westgate were rocked by the devastating sub-prime mortgage collapse. In the new economic reality with the business teetering on ruin, we follow the Siegels as they struggle to scale down their grotesquely ostentatious lifestyle. For this overprivileged family, accepting that situation proved a dispiriting struggle even as their unfinished dream home became a monument of their superficial values.","Language":"French, English","Country":"USA, Netherlands, UK, Denmark","Awards":"8 wins & 26 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MzY0NDc3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAyODY4Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"95%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"80/100"}],"Metascore":"80","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"12,451","imdbID":"tt2125666","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
