But soon, things will go from bad to worse when feeble Campbell will infuriate the scary hot-headed history teacher Ron Strickland, who in turn, he will challenge him in an old-school, no-holds-barred, mano-a-mano throwdown in front of everybody, in the parking lot after school. Inevitably, now that the fight is on, no excuses, no regrets, and certainly no talking sense into Strickland, is going to save Campbell who needs to face the consequences of his actions and pay the heavy price. After all, snitches get stitches.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NzkyMjE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE5NTg3MDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"24%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"37/100"}],"Metascore":"37","imdbRating":"5.6","imdbVotes":"39,213","imdbID":"tt3401882","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Village Roadshow Pictures, New Line Cinema, Wrigley Pictures, 21 Laps Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
