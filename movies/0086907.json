{"Title":"Antonio Gaudí","Year":"1984","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"05 Mar 1986","Runtime":"72 min","Genre":"Documentary","Director":"Hiroshi Teshigahara","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"Isidro Puig Boada, Antoni Gaudí, Seiji Miyaguchi","Plot":"Hiroshi Teshigahara's camera takes us over, under, around, and into buildings and a park designed by Antonio Gaudí (1852 - 1926), Catalan architect, ceramist, and sculptor. Teshigahara suggests the influence of Romanesque churches and monasteries on Gaudí and the influence of the caves and crags of Montserrat, close to Barcelona. Every line of Gaudí's seems curved, and no surface is without textures. With little narration, the film takes us through Casa Vicens, projects for the industrialist Güell (including the Crypt of the Colònia Güell and Park Güell), Casa Batlló, Casa Milà, and Barcelona's landmark, the unfinished Templo de La Sagrada Familia.","Language":"Japanese, Spanish","Country":"Japan","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYwYzJkNjYtZjg0Zi00ODBiLWFjZWMtMTYzOGZkNzA0N2M3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"1,297","imdbID":"tt0086907","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Teshigahara Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
