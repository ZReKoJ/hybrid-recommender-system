{"Title":"Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)","Year":"2002","Rated":"N/A","Released":"10 Mar 2002","Runtime":"102 min","Genre":"Documentary, Music","Director":"AJ Schnack","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"John Flansburgh, John Linnell, Gina Arnold, Michael Azerrad","Plot":"Gigantic is the story of They Might Be Giants, a unique musical group centered on John Flansburgh and John Linnell. We're introduced to the duo's lyrical and melodic craft when, for example, well-known actors recite Giants lyrics, underscoring the dark words often coupled with bright tunes. We also catch a glimpse of the band's ideas about performance from the blend of footage from concerts, television, music videos, and other media. Running through the whole film is a portrayal of the Johns' friendship and ultimately, their view of the world, which we see in interviews with the Giants themselves, their colleagues, and their fans.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyNjIwNjE2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc3MjQyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"82%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"64/100"}],"Metascore":"64","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"684","imdbID":"tt0304081","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
