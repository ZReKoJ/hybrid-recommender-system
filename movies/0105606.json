When the bratty pair hear mother wine all she wants for Christmas is a holiday without the handfuls, they decide to oblige by sneaking off to great grandma Mimi. Unable to find her or the right bus, they end up sneaking into Eddie's truck. He takes to babysitting during his round remarkably well, but when he delivers them home, he's knocked unconscious by senior robbers couple, dumb Harvey and mean Shirley, who stole the content of his firm's trucks, in this case Christmas parcels.
