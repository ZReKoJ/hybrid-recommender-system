On the streets of Japan, a single music store remains open, its proprietor insisting to his customers that the world is not coming to an end. He plays a forgotten song recorded by an obscure band 37 years ago, and insists that somehow, this song will save the world. A series of short stories spans the years from the recording of the song in 1975 to the modern day, and shows how--in roundabout fashion--the man in the music store is absolutely right.","Language":"Japanese","Country":"Japan","Awards":"2 wins & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NzA5NTAzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg0MTE0MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"2,664","imdbID":"tt1244666","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
