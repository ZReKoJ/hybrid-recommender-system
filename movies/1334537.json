To save Ben from domestication, Andrew invites Ben to a party at a sex-positive commune. Everyone there plans on making erotic art films for the local amateur porn festival and Andrew wants in. They run out of booze and ideas, save for one: Andrew should have sex with Ben, on camera. It's not gay; it's beyond gay. It's not porn; it's an art project. The next day, they find themselves unable to back down from the dare. And there's nothing standing in their way - except Ben's wife Anna, heterosexuality, and certain mechanical questions.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"6 wins & 7 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxNTYyODA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk2MDE1Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"79%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"74/100"}],"Metascore":"74","imdbRating":"6.0","imdbVotes":"5,479","imdbID":"tt1334537","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
