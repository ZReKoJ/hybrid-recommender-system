A next-gen wearable device, the Augma doesn't have a full-dive function like its predecessors. Instead, it uses Augmented Reality (AR) to get players into the game. It is safe, user-friendly and lets users play while they are conscious, making it an instant hit on the market. The most popular game on the system is \"Ordinal Scale\" (aka: OS), an ARMMORPG developed exclusively for the Augma. Asuna and the gang have already been playing OS for a while, and soon Kirito decides to join them. However, they're about to find out that Ordinal Scale isn't all fun and games.","Language":"Japanese","Country":"Japan","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE4M2M2OTYtZDgwMy00NGYwLWE0YTYtYzkyMDFjYWFhN2QzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgxODM4NjM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.4/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.4","imdbVotes":"6,082","imdbID":"tt5544384","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
