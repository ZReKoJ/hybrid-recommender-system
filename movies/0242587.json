His mother has just died. His father, a building contractor, can barely keep tabs on his young girlfriend, let alone his own son. Thusly, the teen must navigate his adolescence virtually unsupervised. Floating towards an ill-behaved existence, Howie and his crowd begin robbing houses in the middle-class neighborhoods off the Long Island Expressway. Together, he and his best friend Gary break into a place belonging to an old guy named Big John, a local man who is a respected pillar of the community. When Big John fingers Gary for the crime, Howie learns that his pal has been leading a secret, dangerous but also alluring double life. Subsequently, we also discover that Big John has secrets of his own.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"20 wins & 18 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdkMDNlMmMtM2MxNC00Nzg4LTg5NGYtZjJkOWY4YmViNDBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"73/100"}],"Metascore":"73","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"9,392","imdbID":"tt0242587","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Alter Ego, Belladonna Productions LLC","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
