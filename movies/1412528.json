She finds herself seated at the 'random' table in the back of the ballroom with a disparate group of strangers, most of whom should have known to just send regrets (but not before sending something nice off the registry). As everyone's secrets are revealed, Eloise learns a thing or two from the denizens of Table 19. Friendships - and even a little romance - can happen under the most unlikely circumstances.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQzNzI3NzkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjA4MzczOTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"25%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"40/100"}],"Metascore":"40","imdbRating":"5.8","imdbVotes":"25,890","imdbID":"tt1412528","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"3311 Productions, 21 Laps Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
