Scurlock","Actors":"Beth Naef, Mike Hudson, Louis C.K., Catherine Brown","Plot":"When Hurricane Katrina ravaged America's Gulf Coast, it laid bare an uncomfortable reality-America is not only far from the world's wealthiest nation; it is crumbling beneath a staggering burden of individual and government debt. Maxed Out takes us on a journey deep inside the American debt-style, where everything seems okay as long as the minimum monthly payment arrives on time. Sure, most of us may have that sinking feeling that something isn't quite right, but we're told not to worry. After all, there's always more credit! Maxed Out shows how the modern financial industry really works, explains the true definition of \"preferred customer\" and tells us why the poor are getting poorer and the rich getting richer. By turns hilarious and profoundly disturbing, Maxed Out paints a picture of a national nightmare which is all too real for most of us.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MjQ2NDIyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM2NTM0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"88%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"65/100"}],"Metascore":"65","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"2,117","imdbID":"tt0762117","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Trueworks","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
