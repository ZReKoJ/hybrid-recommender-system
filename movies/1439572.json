At first, it's an outbreak of loss of smell. It's often presaged by a destructive temper tantrum. In this mix are a scientist and a chef - she's Susan, one of a team trying to understand the epidemic; he's Michael, charming and engaging. Susan and Michael begin a relationship in the middle of increasing chaos, as the loss of other senses plagues more people and as civil authorities try to maintain order. Susan's voice-over reflections provide insight. Is love possible in such a changed world? Can anything make perfect sense?","Language":"English, Sign Languages","Country":"UK, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland","Awards":"3 wins & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MjYwMjkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE1NjIxNw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"57%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"55/100"}],"Metascore":"55","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"55,409","imdbID":"tt1439572","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Zentropa Entertainments, BBC Films, Subotica, Sigma","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
