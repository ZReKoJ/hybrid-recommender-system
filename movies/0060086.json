{"Title":"Alfie","Year":"1966","Rated":"PG","Released":"24 Aug 1966","Runtime":"114 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Director":"Lewis Gilbert","Writer":"Bill Naughton (screenplay), Bill Naughton (based on the play: \"Alfie\")","Actors":"Michael Caine, Shelley Winters, Millicent Martin, Julia Foster","Plot":"For Alfie, the only real life is sex life; only then can he kid himself he is living. Sex is not used as the working-class boy's way to 'the top'. Executive status has no appeal for Alfie. Nor has class mobility. He is quite content to stay where he is, as long as the 'birds' are in 'beautiful condition', as he assures us they are in one of the candid, over-the-shoulder asides to the camera which the film carries over from \"Tom Jones\". The film shows how much of the 'swinging 60's' quality of London life was a male creation, and through the dominance of the fashion photographers, a male prerogative.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"Nominated for 5 Oscars.
