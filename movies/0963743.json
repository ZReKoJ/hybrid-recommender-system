Eldest daughter Georgia is completely besotted with 'Stiff Dylans' band hottie Robbie, who just moved in from London and helps run an organic groceries shop with his brother Tom, whom her best friend Jas has the hots for. Peter Dyer calls Georgia his best ever kissing-course pupil, but she ignores him and later the brothers' other classmate Dave the Laugh. Robbie was considering to dump haughty Lindsay, but reconsiders given the immature brat's apparent cruelty. Thus manipulative Georgia keeps changing her mind about a grand birthday party and her father's career opportunities as engineer in New Zealand, while mother seems to flirt with hunky interior decorator Jem.","Language":"English","Country":"USA, Germany, UK","Awards":"3 wins & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MTg0NjcyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQxNTQ4MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"72%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"25,366","imdbID":"tt0963743","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Bend It Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
