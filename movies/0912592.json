The showing of her work started off as a lark, but when the paintings sold without the buyers knowing who the artist was, the media began to run with the story. Through it all, Marla's parents, Mark Olmstead and Laura Olmstead, want to be grounded in what is best for their daughter while exposing her to whatever positive may come from the experience. But some negative and big name media also surfaces, some questioning whether Marla is the real artist behind the work, and some questioning exposing a four year old to such infamy. Regardless, the fact of this art selling brings up the legitimacy of abstract art being quantified as \"quality\", especially if a four year old can produce it but can't express the emotions or rationale behind its creation. Or is art truly in the eyes of the beholder? Regardless, money, in the art world as is much in life, becomes the great equalizer.","Language":"English, Mandarin","Country":"USA, UK","Awards":"7 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMjY4OTQwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE5NjA1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"94%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"74/100"}],"Metascore":"74","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"3,163","imdbID":"tt0912592","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"A&amp;E IndieFilms, Passion Pictures, BBC","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
