{"Title":"For the Bible Tells Me So","Year":"2007","Rated":"Unrated","Released":"05 Oct 2007","Runtime":"95 min","Genre":"Documentary, Romance","Director":"Daniel G. Karslake","Writer":"Daniel G. Karslake, Helen R. Mendoza","Actors":"Imogene Robinson, Victor Robinson, Gene Robinson, Isabella 'Boo' McDaniel","Plot":"We meet five Christian families, each with a gay or lesbian child. Parents talk about their marriages and church-going, their children's childhood and coming out, their reactions, and changes over time. The stories told by these nine parents and four adult children alternate with talking heads - Protestant and Jewish theologians - and with film clips of fundamentalist preachers and pundits and news clips of people in the street. They discuss scripture and biblical scholarship. A thesis of the film is that much of Christianity's homophobia represents a misreading of scripture, a denial of science, and an embrace of quack psychology. The families call for love.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE1Mzk4ODUtZWEzZS00MWY2LWFjMTItNmUzM2MxYmJiMWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"98%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"73/100"}],"Metascore":"73","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"4,317","imdbID":"tt0912583","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
