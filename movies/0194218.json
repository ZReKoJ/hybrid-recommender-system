He also tells the doctor, after a few sessions, that he's attracted to a young woman he's met in the waiting room. She's Sarah, 23, quick, edgy, and perhaps attracted to him as well. But he's married, the dutiful father of a young precocious boy, so Sarah brushes him off. In flashbacks we see him get his start as a killer, at his father's prompting: it's the family business. Dad gives Alex his next assignment: to kill the therapist. Alex keeps returning to Sarah, calling her, stopping by her apartment, as he decides what to do about the hit, his father, his marriage, and his malaise.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMjgyMzgxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE5NTgyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"91%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"77/100"}],"Metascore":"77","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"7,930","imdbID":"tt0194218","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Tin Toy Productions, Llc, Mad Chance, Vault, Artisan Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
