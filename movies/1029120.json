He drinks and eats pizza. Recent stucco work has left a brown stain in a patio wall, and, to Henry's irritation, Esperanza, a neighbor, is certain she can see the face of Jesus in the stain. She brings her priest, then others. Meanwhile, Henry hears his conversations replayed over the fence in another neighbor's yard: it's Millie, about 7, mute, clutching a tape recorder. He tells Millie's mom why he's sad and angry. The face on the wall seems to shed a tear of blood. Is Henry beyond feeling any emotion?","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5ODIwNzg0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE0NDY3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"40%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"44/100"}],"Metascore":"44","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"12,231","imdbID":"tt1029120","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Lakeshore Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
