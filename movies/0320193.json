When released, he calls on the family of the victim; they send him away, but not before he has seen Gong-ju, a young woman disabled severely by cerebral palsy. Both are abused by their families, and both are used by them as well. Although their relationship begins with Jong-du's criminal behavior, a friendship develops. They talk of favorite things; he washes her hair; they go out; in late night phone calls, he helps her past her fears of the dark. Is there a place in the world for these two inarticulate people?","Language":"Korean","Country":"South Korea","Awards":"23 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjYwNGYwM2ItZGFmMy00ZjdiLWJjNWMtNTA4YjA1MTc0OTdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjcxNjI4NTk@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"90%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"79/100"}],"Metascore":"79","imdbRating":"7.9","imdbVotes":"7,983","imdbID":"tt0320193","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Dream Venture Capital, UniKorea Pictures, East Film Company","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
