Naturally, her parents are searching for a wealthy, well-appointed husband to assure their daughter's future social standing. They are eyeing Mr. Wisley, nephew to the very formidable, not to mention very rich, local aristocrat Lady Gresham, as a prospective match. But when Jane meets the roguish and decidedly non-aristocratic Tom Lefroy, sparks soon fly along with the sharp repartee. His intellect and arrogance raise her ire - then knock her head over heels. Now, the couple, whose flirtation flies in the face of the sense and sensibility of the age, is faced with a terrible dilemma. If they attempt to marry, they will risk everything that matters - family, friends and fortune.","Language":"English","Country":"UK, Ireland","Awards":"3 wins & 6 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMjQyMDMxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAwOTM1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"58%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"55/100"}],"Metascore":"55","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"57,781","imdbID":"tt0416508","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Blueprint Pictures, Scion Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
