His former girlfriend, Blair, is now involved with his ex-best-friend, Julian. She warns Clay that Julian needs help: he is using a lot of cocaine and has huge debts. What follows is a look at the youth culture of wealthy post adolescents in Beverly Hills with a strong anti-drug message. Apart from the setting and the names, the film has very little to do with Bret Easton Ellis's book by the same title on which it was based.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk5NzQ1NDk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI1NjcxMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"50%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"48/100"}],"Metascore":"48","imdbRating":"6.5","imdbVotes":"18,042","imdbID":"tt0093407","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"20th Century Fox","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
