To pass the long hours of the night, he starts working the late night shift at the local supermarket. There he meets a colorful cast of characters, all of whom have their own 'art' in dealing with the boredom of an eight-hour-shift. Ben's art is that he imagines himself stopping time. This way, he can appreciate the artistic beauty of the frozen world and the people inside it - especially Sharon, the pretty and quiet checkout girl, who perhaps holds the answer to solving the problem of Ben's insomnia.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"UK","Awards":"3 wins.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhiZmYwMWEtZmZiOC00NDhhLWFhMjQtZmQ5Mjc0NjZhZjFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"48%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"54/100"}],"Metascore":"54","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"82,516","imdbID":"tt0460740","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
