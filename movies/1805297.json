Jean-Louis Joubert is a serious but uptight stockbroker, married to Suzanne, a starchy class-conscious woman and father of two arrogant teenage boys, currently in a boarding school. The affluent man lives a steady yet boring life. At least until, due to fortuitous circumstances, Maria, the charming new maid at the service of Jean-Louis' family, makes him discover the servants' quarter on the sixth floor of the luxury building he owns and lives in. There live a crowd of lively Spanish maids who will help Jean-Louis to open to a new civilization and a new approach of life. In their company - and more precisely in the company of beautiful Maria - Jean-Louis will gradually become another man, a better man.","Language":"French, Spanish","Country":"France","Awards":"2 wins & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MzY2OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM3NTIyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"67%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"52/100"}],"Metascore":"52","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"9,558","imdbID":"tt1805297","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Vendôme Production, France 2 Cinéma","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
