It's dusty and back-breaking work, but Iremar is a natural vaqueiro feeding, prepping and taking care of the bulls. Home is the truck used to transport the animals from show to show which he shares with his coworkers; Galega, an exotic dancer, truck driver and mother to her spirited and cheeky daughter Cacá, and Zé, his rotund compadre in the bull pen. Together they form a makeshift but close-knit family. But Brazil and the Northeast are changing and the region's booming clothing industry has stirred new ambitions in Iremar. Swinging in his hammock in the back of the truck, his head is filled with dreams of pattern cutting, sequins and exquisite fabrics as he mentally assembles his latest sexy fashion designs.","Language":"Portuguese","Country":"Brazil, Uruguay, Netherlands","Awards":"32 wins & 36 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0ODM0MDg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjgxMjUzODE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"88%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"80/100"}],"Metascore":"80","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"2,648","imdbID":"tt4899406","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
