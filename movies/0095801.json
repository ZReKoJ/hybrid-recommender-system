This movie exemplifies how one person in the right place can affect a community of lives. The Adlons seem to express the view that all change and \"magic\" comes from hard work and mutual acceptance. A well-crafted view of the lives of tourists everywhere and the difficulties they can face. A Whimsical and lovingly Photographed look at the vast wasteland that is too often ignored by much of humanity.","Language":"English, German","Country":"West Germany","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.
