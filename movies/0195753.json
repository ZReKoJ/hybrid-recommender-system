{"Title":"Eddie Izzard: Glorious","Year":"1997","Rated":"Unrated","Released":"N/A","Runtime":"99 min","Genre":"Documentary, Comedy","Director":"Peter Richardson","Writer":"Eddie Izzard","Actors":"Eddie Izzard","Plot":"Eddie Izzard's routine has a loose trajectory from the beginning of the Old Testament and the creation of the world in seven days to Revelations; God, in the voice of James Mason, makes several appearances. Along the way, Izzard dramatizes or comments on the search for a career, bad giraffes, Prince Philip's gaffes, toilets in French campsites, the mysteries of hopscotch, becoming one's Dad, getting a computer to print, and his court victory after being the victim of tranny bashing. Izzard calls his bits \"mimes,\" in part because his physical comedy is sans props. Filmed at Labatt's Apollo Theatre, Izzard is in a shimmering red pants suit and low heels.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMTc2MjU2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc4MjcyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.4/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"8.4","imdbVotes":"2,439","imdbID":"tt0195753","Type":"movie","DVD":"18 Jan 2005","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
