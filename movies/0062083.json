It is indeed under the sign of trouble... and of confusion that the crappy day Bertrand Barnier has just gone through will have been placed. The businessman will not forget it soon! And quite rightly so. Just imagine: a maid that wants to resign to... marry a baron! A masseur who treats you like an executioner of the Holy Inquisition! And, to cap it all, a right-hand man who breaks shocking news after shocking news (demanding a high pay increase, saying he has relieved his employer of a bunch of millions, stating that he has decided to marry his daughter who, incidentally, has been made pregnant by Oscar the former driver...) To say nothing of three black suitcases, one of which contains millions of francs, passing from hand to hand! Is it really possible to make sense of such wild confusion? As that crazy day ends, Barnier thinks he has achieved the impossible. But has he really?","Language":"French","Country":"France","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU2ZmYyZjAtMGYyMy00MDBiLTk2NzEtYjBhNjdiNzE2ZDA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzM3NDI3._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"82%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"5,716","imdbID":"tt0062083","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Gaumont International","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
