However, Celestine, an apprentice mouse dentist, finds at least momentary common cause with Ernest, a poor street Bear musician, that gets them rejected from both their respective worlds. In spite of this misfortune, the exiles find a growing friendship between themselves as their respective talents flower because of it.

When that happens, Ernest and Celestine must stand up for their love in the face of such bigotry and achieve the impossible.","Language":"French, English","Country":"France, Belgium, Luxembourg","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.
