But this delicate balance was ripped apart when the alien apocalypse arrived in Dillford and put an end to all the harmony. Now it's humans vs. vampires vs. zombies in all-out, blood-sucking, brain-eating, vamp-staking mortal combat - and all of them are on the run from the aliens. It is up to three teenagers - one human, one vampire, and one zombie - to team up, figure out how to get rid of the interplanetary visitors, and try to restore order to this \"normal\" little town.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"5 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MTMyMTEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0MDYwNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"45%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.9","imdbVotes":"10,808","imdbID":"tt1817771","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
