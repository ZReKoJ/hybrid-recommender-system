He tells his boss that he must attend his mother-in-law's funeral. The afternoon is no joy. He tries to please a policeman, assist a chauffeur, chase a tire, and ends up getting hit by the body of a wrestler thrown from the ring. A series of mishaps leads his boss to send floral tributes to the house and notify the papers of the death (due to poisoned liquor). His shrewish wife, judgmental mother-in-law, and good-for-nothing brother-in-law add to his burdens. In the end he enjoys their fawning loyalty, a raise in pay, and his first vacation.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc5NTYyODktM2FhNC00YTE0LTllMGMtNjQyMDAzNTdhYmQ3L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"79%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"910","imdbID":"tt0026676","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Paramount","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
