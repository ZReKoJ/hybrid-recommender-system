Thanks to tenaciously bugging a Congressman he's selected, despite dubious grades. Once inside Jake soon proves sub-standard academically. Constantly challenged to his limits, repeatedly made the 'over-cocky' reason for the entire class to suffer, Jake nearly quits, but after facing his utterly unsupportive father's gloating returns just in time. Stubborn Jake finds support with mates as well as Ali, his lover-to-be, and a discipline he may excel in: the 'brigade' boxing tournament, open to all ranks.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQxMzA1Mjk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM5NjEzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"10%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"37/100"}],"Metascore":"37","imdbRating":"5.9","imdbVotes":"20,185","imdbID":"tt0417433","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Touchstone Pictures","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
