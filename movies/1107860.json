Till","Plot":"Three middle-age guards learn that their museum has sold a wing of art to a Danish museum. Each has a favorite in that collection, and none can imagine life without the peace and completion it brings. Though mere acquaintances, they plot a theft of the three pieces between the time they are packed and the time they're loaded onto a plane. First each must obtain a forgery; then, they have to smuggle the forgeries into the museum and find a way to make the switches. The heist is complicated by Roger's intrusive wife - he's promised her a trip to Florida for their anniversary - and George's proclivity for taking his clothes off when standing in front of the warrior statue he loves.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MTc0MjE0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzI4Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"37%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.1","imdbVotes":"15,448","imdbID":"tt1107860","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Yari Film Group, Revelations Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
