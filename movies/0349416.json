Son Daniel is a secret porn actor, and daughter Lucy is a lesbian. Lucy totes along her lover Judy to the outrage of Lucy's aggressively neurotic sister Alice, whose hysterical overreaction to the pair's marriage plans ought to tell everyone something. Rounding out the delightful crowd are dim brother Skip, whose unfailingly rude twin sons offer caustic commentary on their elders' infantile predilections; matriarchal widow Charlotte, who becomes so justifiably distraught at the insanity of her children she tries to commit suicide; and Kate, a confused but comely college freshman who juggles preparation of the eulogy with internal debate over what to do with her childhood friend-turned-suitor, Ryan.","Language":"English","Country":"UK, Germany, USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMDA1MjEzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIwMDEwNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"34%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"34/100"}],"Metascore":"34","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"8,511","imdbID":"tt0349416","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Equity Pictures Medienfonds, Haft Entertainment, Myriad Pictures, Ovation Entertainment LLC, Eulogy Productions LLC, Cherry Road Films LLC","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
