He and his sarcastic manipulative brother still behave like teenagers, living with their parents, harassing each other. The problem is that they are in their late teens or twenties.

Trouble ensues when their wealthy aunt gives Colin a job and his brother becomes jealous.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZiYTU5YTEtZDUwYi00ZmZmLWE3YTQtMGIwZWEyOTJkMzM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"75%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"69/100"}],"Metascore":"69","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"3,183","imdbID":"tt0082727","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Central Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
