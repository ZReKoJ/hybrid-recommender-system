As Bob the Tomato and the kids settle in to wait for a tow truck to help get their van back on the road, the \"Pirates Who Don't Do Anything\" share a little story about a guy named Jonah. Jonah was kind of like a mailman except his messages came straight from God. Jonah loves his job, until the day comes when he has to deliver a message to the people of Nineveh. Instead of carrying out his mission, Jonah turns and sets sail in the opposite direction onboard a pirate ship. Soon Jonah embarks on an adventure that leads him into the belly of a whale, and to the heart of Nineveh for a hilarious showdown.","Language":"English","Country":"USA, UK","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0OTk5MTk0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTgxMDg5._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"66%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"58/100"}],"Metascore":"58","imdbRating":"6.5","imdbVotes":"3,834","imdbID":"tt0298388","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Big Idea Productions Inc.","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
