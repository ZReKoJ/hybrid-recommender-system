{"Title":"Naked Lunch","Year":"1991","Rated":"R","Released":"24 Apr 1992","Runtime":"115 min","Genre":"Drama","Director":"David Cronenberg","Writer":"William S. Burroughs (novel), David Cronenberg","Actors":"Peter Weller, Judy Davis, Ian Holm, Julian Sands","Plot":"Not an adaptation of beat writer William S. Burrough's novel but a mix of biography and an interpretation of his drug- induced writing processes combined with elements of his work in this paranoid fantasy about Bill Lee, a writer who accidentally shoots his wife, whose typewriter transforms into a cockroach and who becomes involved in a mysterious plot in North African port called Interzone. Wonderfully bizarre, not unlike Burrough's books.","Language":"English, Arabic","Country":"Canada, UK, Japan","Awards":"13 wins & 17 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRiOTQ2ZWQtMmIwYy00Y2Y3LWFmMzgtNzgzZWU1MDhlOGJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"69%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"67/100"}],"Metascore":"67","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"46,145","imdbID":"tt0102511","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Recorded Picture Company (RPC)","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
