When his patience wears out, she's shipped off to her mother's former English boarding school for girls, Abbey Mount. On her first day she makes enemies of most dorm mates, especially dominant lacrosse school captain Harriet, and the school's principal Mrs. Kingsley. Unwilling to accept the strict regime, she decides to misbehave and take the blame for everyone until she's dismissed. The school only appealing feature for her is Kingsley's dashing son Freddie. When the dream prince transfers his favor from ambitious, uptight Harriet to unruly Poppy, that changes everything.","Language":"English","Country":"USA, UK, France","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUzYTM2YjgtN2I5OC00MmIwLWJhOTgtNjc1ZmFmYzI3MTUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"41%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.1","imdbVotes":"49,147","imdbID":"tt1024255","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Working Title Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
