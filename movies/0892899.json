To this gang of hardened warriors, battle-worn veterans and borderline criminals killing is just a job - and one they enjoy. Their mission - to scope out an old military bunker. It should be easy - 48 hours at the most. Lots of cash for little risk, or so he says. Once at the outpost, the men make a horrific discovery that turns their mission on its head - the scene of a bloody and gruesome series of experiments, carried out by the Nazis on their own soldiers during WWII. Amid the carnage, they find something even more disturbing - someone who's still alive. As war rages above ground, and a mysterious enemy emerges from the darkness below, D.C. and his men find themselves trapped in a claustrophobic and terrifying scenario. Their mission is no longer one of safe-guarding - it's one of survival. Together they must discover why Hunt has brought them to the outpost - and what it is that's killing them off, one by one.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRmYmExZDItNjA4ZC00MzI2LWFiYmItZDRkOWZjNWVkZTdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"34%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.8","imdbVotes":"16,105","imdbID":"tt0892899","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Black Camel Pictures","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
