Includes private rehearsals footage and Chappelle in the small Ohio town he calls home, where he wanders through town handing out golden tickets to invite several dozen citizens to join the party, providing transportation and lodging for their visit to Brooklyn. Ohio's Central State University marching band makes the trip and kicks off the festivities at the intersection of Quincy and Downing Streets. A diverse crowd and Chappelle's freestyle wit guides them (and us) through a celebration of music and comedy, history and community.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"3 wins & 4 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5ODAyNDM3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ3NTIzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"84/100"}],"Metascore":"84","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"8,772","imdbID":"tt0425598","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Bob Yari Productions, Pilot Boy Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
