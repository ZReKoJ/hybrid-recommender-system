There's a searing pain in his gut that he can't tolerate and a dazed quietness to his struggle as he tries to maintain his equilibrium. Wilson is attempting to move on from the sudden and inexplicable suicide of his wife. His mother-in-law is there for him, but her sympathies turn quickly. He has an employer that seems to want to help him, and a workmate who wants him for herself. But nothing and no one can give Wilson solace; so, he seeks oblivion. It is not the usual alcohol or drugs. Wilson inhales fumes from gasoline cans and model airplane fuel and finds temporary salvation in the company of remote-control model enthusiasts. However, nothing that provides him relief really lasts.","Language":"English","Country":"France, Germany, USA","Awards":"2 wins & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwNmUyOTctNDYxZC00MjUzLTljZTEtODNkMGVjYTQyN2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"53%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"58/100"}],"Metascore":"58","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"7,223","imdbID":"tt0282698","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Sony Pictures Classics","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
