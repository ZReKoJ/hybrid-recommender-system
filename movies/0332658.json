When the desperately insecure and emotionally inarticulate John breaks up with Deirdre to 'give her a little test' his plan backfires leaving her broken-hearted and him alone and miserable. Through chance and coincidence, their break-up triggers a roller coaster ride of interweaving escapades in the lives of everyone around them. Intermission presents a slice of life, the passage between breaking up and making up, exploring how our lives intersect, and the power we all possess to affect the lives of those around us.","Language":"English","Country":"Ireland, UK","Awards":"9 wins & 12 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjQzNzYyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg0MzUyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"73%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"64/100"}],"Metascore":"64","imdbRating":"6.8","imdbVotes":"15,022","imdbID":"tt0332658","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Parallel Films, Brown Sauce Film Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
