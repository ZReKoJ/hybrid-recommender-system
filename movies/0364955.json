Competition and petty jealousy consume faculty and students, with an end-of-first-semester best-student award held out as a grand plum. Worse, a strangler is on the loose, killing people on or next to campus. The idealistic Jerome falls in love with Audrey, a student who models for life-drawing classes and who responds to his sweetness. But he has a rival: the clean-cut, manly Jonah, also a first-year drawing student, whose primitive work draws raves and Audrey's attention. As cynicism seems to corrode everything, Jerome is desperate to win.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2NzUzNzIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgxNDgzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"36%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"54/100"}],"Metascore":"54","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"16,553","imdbID":"tt0364955","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"United Artists","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
