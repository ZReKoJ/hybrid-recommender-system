She doesn't want to travel by herself, but has no boyfriend and seems unable to meet new people. A friend takes her to Cherbourg; after a few days there, the weepy and self-pitying Delphine goes back to Paris. She tries the Alps, but returns the same day. Next, it's the beach: once there, she chats with an outgoing Swede, a party girl, and a friendship seems to bud; then, suddenly, Delphine bolts, heading back to Paris. As she waits at the Biarritz train station, a young man catches her eye; perhaps a sunset and the sun's green ray await.","Language":"French, English, Spanish, German","Country":"France","Awards":"5 wins.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDU3NmE3MDEtODY0Ni00NDdhLThhYzMtZTM0YjUzMmY1ZTFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMzQzODY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"93%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"6,314","imdbID":"tt0091830","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Les Films du Losange","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
