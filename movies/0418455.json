He's odd: seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, in denial about personal facts, and convinced he's at war with Satan. The rectory is a half-way house for recently paroled convicts. Adam arrives for 12 weeks, a large, tough neo-Nazi, first baffled by Ivan's thick-headed optimism, then angry. He vows to break Ivan's faith. Meanwhile, in exasperation at Ivan's insistence, Adam sets a personal goal: to bake an apple pie. All goes awry for the tree: crows, worms, lightening. The Book of Job gives Adam perverse insight, and his hooligan mates provide the resolution's spring.","Language":"Danish","Country":"Denmark, Germany","Awards":"20 wins & 13 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NTc5NjM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyMTE0MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"70%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"51/100"}],"Metascore":"51","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"44,920","imdbID":"tt0418455","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"M&amp;M Productions, August Film &amp; TV GmbH, Danmarks Radio","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
