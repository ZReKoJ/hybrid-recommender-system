The forger creates the paintings; Tom sells them. But another criminal business associate wants Tom to go in for an even riskier enterprise: murder. Tom suggests his associate ask a local picture framer instead. That man has a fatal disease, or so it's rumored. More, he has a wife and kid that surely he wouldn't want to leave penniless. Let this picture framer be a hit man, and no one will suspect. The terminally ill craftsman may agree to the misdeed, and several more, but he'll end up needing Tom Ripley in a pinch.","Language":"German, English, French","Country":"West Germany, France","Awards":"6 wins & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWFlZDA1YTQtMGJjYy00OTVlLTkxODUtNTgxNWNiMTZkYmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"91%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"79/100"}],"Metascore":"79","imdbRating":"7.4","imdbVotes":"13,173","imdbID":"tt0075675","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Bavaria Film","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
