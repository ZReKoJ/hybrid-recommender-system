Rafi's therapist, Dr. Lisa Metzger, who is working to help Rafi overcome her fears of intimacy, finds out that Rafi's new lover is--unfortunately for Lisa--her only son, David. Both David and Rafi must contend with their 14-year age gap, vastly different backgrounds and the demands of David's traditional mother. Despite their intense attraction, the charmed couple soon realizes that vastly different ages and backgrounds create much conflict. A Jewish hip-hop lover and closet painter who still lives with his grandparents, David has little in common with Rafi--a non-practicing Catholic from a wealthy, broken family who travels in the sophisticated, high-end world of fashion.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMDg4MjUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTgwNDU3._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"50%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"58/100"}],"Metascore":"58","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"39,387","imdbID":"tt0387514","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Team Todd","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
