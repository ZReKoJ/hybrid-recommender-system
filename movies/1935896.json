Inspired by children's educational ABC books, the motion picture is comprised of 26 individual chapters, each helmed by a different director assigned a letter of the alphabet. The directors were then given free reign in choosing a word to create a story involving death. Provocative, shocking, funny and ultimately confrontational; THE ABC's OF DEATH is the definitive snapshot of the diversity of modern horror. Drafthouse Films, Magnet Pictures and Timpson Films are proud to present this alphabetical arsenal of destruction orchestrated by what Fangoria calls \"a stunning roll call of some of the most exciting names in horror across the world.\"","Language":"English, Spanish, Japanese, German, French, Korean","Country":"USA, New Zealand","Awards":"2 wins & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNTA0OTIxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA3MTM2Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"4.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"37%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"43/100"}],"Metascore":"43","imdbRating":"4.7","imdbVotes":"17,889","imdbID":"tt1935896","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Magnet Releasing","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
