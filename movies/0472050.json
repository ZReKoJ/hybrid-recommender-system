Everyone including Camille and her parents assumes that Danny will ask her to the prom, but he wants something less platonic and more romantic - more memorable. His choices include the sophomore cheerleader he drives to school, a friend of a friend, and a quiet Chinese girl in his classes. With his parents' help (they're going through a divorce), he gets the tickets, rents a tux, reserves a limo, and, over his mother's objections, gets a room at the prom-site hotel. This, everyone believes, is the way to establish memories. Will anything work out?","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 win.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MDA1NDEwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU4MzIzMg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"70%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"57/100"}],"Metascore":"57","imdbRating":"5.6","imdbVotes":"3,966","imdbID":"tt0472050","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Plum Pictures","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
