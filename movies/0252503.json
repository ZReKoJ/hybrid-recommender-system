Gene Hackman plays the brilliant leader of a gang (Delroy Lindo, Ricky Jay & Rebecca Pigeon as Hackman's youngish wife), which pulls off complex heists for a despicable fence (Danny DeVito).

No one trusts anyone and every step is shaded with the unexpected.","Language":"English","Country":"Canada, USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBiNTNlZTMtZjlmNC00ZGI0LWI2YjctODA4MzNlYjEyNzQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"66%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"66/100"}],"Metascore":"66","imdbRating":"6.5","imdbVotes":"33,161","imdbID":"tt0252503","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Morgan Creek Productions, Indelible Pictures, Franchise Pictures","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
