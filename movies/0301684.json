One day, he sees his old family and friends - including his older foster sister Carol, her boyfriend/his old buddy Charlie, Jimmy's ex-wife and Carol's best friend Shirley, and Jimmy's pre-teen daughter Marlene - on a television talk show, they baring their souls to a national audience. He has not seen any of them in years. Of note on the show, Shirley rejects the marriage proposal of her slightly awkward live-in boyfriend Dek. Jimmy sees her answer to Dek as a reason to head back to the Midlands to reunite with his past, especially with Shirley and Marlene. Dek, already humiliated, is less than thrilled to see Jimmy back in their lives. In the ensuing duel between Jimmy and Dek for Shirley and Marlene's affections, others get caught up in the crossfire. Meanwhile, three of Jimmy's equally hapless crook friends from Glasgow come looking for him, Jimmy who left them high and dry at their latest heist and who absconded with all the money.","Language":"English","Country":"UK, Germany","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2ODkzOTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzk0NTk2._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"51%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"56/100"}],"Metascore":"56","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"4,157","imdbID":"tt0301684","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Big Arty","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
