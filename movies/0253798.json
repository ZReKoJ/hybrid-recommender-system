Cook, David Denman, Caroline Dhavernas","Plot":"Bull Mountain, Alaska, is a no frills ski resort, and the staff is a bunch of partying snowboard bums. The late founder, Papa Muntz, was famed for skiing with his backside exposed, and in fact is so memorialized by a statue. But his son, Ted, plans to sell the resort to hotshot ski mogul John Majors, who starts turning it into a slick resort, which of course has no room for most of the staff. The exception is Rick, the most serious of the bunch. But there's a complication: Rick met Majors' stepdaughter Anna on vacation in Mexico, and he's never gotten over a crush he had on her, even though she's about to marry a great guy. And Rick is also fiercely loyal to his friends.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NTczOTE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzcyNTQyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"8%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"22/100"}],"Metascore":"22","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"16,602","imdbID":"tt0253798","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Touchstone Pictures, Spyglass Entertainment, Donners&#39; Company","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
