Three fun loving sergeants are doing fine until one of them wants to get married and leave the service. The other two trick him into a final mission where they end up confronting the entire cult by themselves as the British Army is entering a trap. This is of the \"War is fun\" school of movie making. It has the flavour of watching Notre Dame play an inferior high school team.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.
